We all enjoyed this strain but saw potential for better medicinal-level duration and better flavor lurking within, namely due to what we see as a slightly early harvest and not-quite thorough enough flush.

If the peak potency were a little higher, it would've been an easy A, but it just didn't grab all of our review staff with its effects, which were mostly just base relaxation and a slight uptick in cerebral activity. The grow was nearly flawless, the sample was rather beautiful, the smell and taste both were above-average and enjoyable… it was just one of those strains that might never get into the upper-echelon of modern medical cannabis, as this seems to be pretty much its genetic potential.

The dank rubber-fuel-skunk front notes has a background of spice and citrus, making for an almost overwhelming scent package before it's even ground up. The post-grind aroma brought to mind a bit more of the Sour Diesel, with a stronger kick of fresh citrus and an almost floral quality once it settled.

"Not outwardly as frosty-looking and tight as the sample we received from its mother plant (the Coup de Grace), this one was a little loose in structure, but it made for a pretty striking appearance and left the hands sticky after handling. Dark army greens overall blended with thick ropey orange pistils — the tall, just-on-the-verge-of-ambered trichomes weren't that apparent until under the scope.","This sample carried strong notes of peaches and blueberries along with a little of the saccharine sweet you find in Bubblegum strains. An interesting almost liquor-like menthol sweet bite was present as well, with above-average pungency overall.","When we got this sample, Dr. Blaze informed us that this was the first real batch ready for the public and that it will be receiving lots of attention and improvements over the coming months. That jives with our experience for sure, as it appeared that this one just didn't quite reach the genetic potential it holds. The Coup mother was one of the nicest in-house creations we've come across, and with the Widow potency, we were expecting a little more of a slam/couchlock experience. But it remained mostly heady (though having GREAT anti-anxiety and solid body relaxation properties), leaving us functional though a little dull-feeling… can't wait to see this one in its completely dialed-in form.","While it was difficult to pick up (one review reported no taste), we were able to notice a floral and ethereal berry sweetness with hints of smokey almost tequila-like flavor.

After that hour had passed, it retreated to a fairly neutral yet relaxed state where mood wasn't necessarily enhanced but not soured either.

"Though this sample probably wouldn't stand out in a row of jars full of top shelf strains, it certainly belongs there judging from its coating of well-preserved trichomes and overall healthy appearance.","This strain smelled like almost every other top-notch Jack Herer or Jack hybrid (including Jack Flash) and definitely ranked among the top examples we've had in that vein — super fresh and ""cool"" lemon-pine cleaner smell with a wonderful backing floral sweetness that seemed to come out more post-grind. The post-grind smell reminded one reviewer of grenadine — very nice. It wasn't super-pungent mostly due to its Haze nature, but did majorly increase in pungency when ground-up.","Despite the long duration, this one didn't stay at peak potency for very long, only feeling strong for 45 minutes or so , then feeling eminently functional and basically scaling down from there until it was barely noticeable at about two and a half hours. That said, the effects were great for all of us and made this a pretty perfect daytime medication no matter the activity… it would be good for creative pursuits, data entry/menial type of work, watching a movie, etc. — anything where sustained attention is desirable would be enhanced by this one. Taste and smell-wise, it pretty much brought the expected Jack Herer bag of smells and tastes, though the smell in particular was top-notch and would be the deciding factor to make us give this strain a try amongst 20 others. This is recommended as a fairly motivational and focused daytime type of med for those who don't need serious pain relief or enduring top-level potency.","Not quite as ""Jack-y"" as the smell, the flavor was a little more muted, with some slightly earthy notes at times overpowering the spicy, flowery Haze flavor.

Physically, the strain started with the hallmark Sativa effects such as orbital/eye/head pressure, a slightly buzzing body, and an uptick in both mood and heart rate.

It also had some hints of soil (probably the Northern Lights influence) and pine as well, making it a well-rounded spectrum of pleasing aromas.","The appearance of this strain is probably what most people would talk about if forced to choose, as it is truly impressive and beautiful, possessing both great structure as well as trichome coverage. Though we wanted the taste to match the lovely smell, it was adequate and didn't harm the experience in the least — the smoke was very smooth and enjoyable. The area where this strain really shined though was in its initial potency and its long-lasting duration, both of which were top-notch.

The particular brand of functional Indica relief this strain offered will help almost anyone dealing with daily pains and stresses while leaving them able to live their lives capably and handle social and professional situations. This new cross is great for intermediate users but will even impress the connoisseurs with its appearance and staying power.","This strain had a middling taste — it certainly wasn't bad, but it just didn't grab us in the way we were expecting after the aroma.

"Dark leaves and purple petioles lend an undoubtedly Indica appearance to the plant overall, and it will often finish completely purple depending upon nutrient regime and temperature.  Most often the finished buds are a robust medium green with bright orange pistils, with mottled purple tinges appearing commonly on the top nugs moreso than the lower buds.  Large, fat calyxes bristle with tall, medium-headed trichomes which pack the surface with a density in the upper echelon of strains.  The buds are most similar to Urkle buds in overall appearance, round and swelled-up with a moderate amount of leaves mixed in.","One of the most pungent strains we've ever encountered, the very complex interplay of the Urkle's grape-spice musk and the Tres Dawg's hair-curling Chem-skunk funk will impress anyone who likes an aggressive aroma.  The plant when growing will stink more than 95% of strains and that translates to the final product as well — buds left untouched will exhibit a more soft Purple-tinged aroma, but as soon as they're broken apart, it's deep ChemDawg acridness and skunk-fuel all the way.","Coming out of the breeding projects of a grower known as ""High & Lonesome"", with the blessings of Top Dawg Seeds (the holders of Tres Dawg), this hybrid combines the legendaryPurple Urkleclone with JJ-NYC's fiercely potent Tres Dawg, which is essentially a Chem D backcross.  The Urkle imparts its signature coloration and some of its aroma and flavor, but the added sharp chemical kick of the Chem D makes everything more interesting than a standard ""purple"" and make this variety one of the strongest-smelling strains in almost any garden.  Also increased is the potency of the Urkle, making it much more sedative and hard-hitting cerebrally — this strain is best used in the evenings, as it can lead to sleep due to the deep relaxation and strong ocular effects is offers.","Falling just shy of the aroma in terms of overall pungency, the Waltz's flavor matches the qualities of the smell perfectly, offering the same blend of fruity-spicy Purple sweetness and overwhelming Chemmy funk.",54 - 60 days,"Limited seed release, but it's mostly clone-only, with a few different select cuts floating around","Though it produces a moderate-to-large yield of rock-hard and large-calyxed buds, the Waltz also produces quite a lot of fan leaves, and fairly aggressive defoliation is suggested in order to maximize yield of lower bud sites.  The plant is a fairly heavy feeder, often requiring additional Cal-Mag through early flower.  It grows rather stout and bushy, with only a small stretch during flowering, mostly fattening up rather than growing upwards.  Taking it on the early side of the harvest window normally results in the best flavor and a more cerebral effect, while allowing some amber trichomes to develop puts this strain squarely on the Indica side of things effects-wise and seems to take some of the sweetness out of the flavor.",Purple Urkle x Tres Dawg (Chem D x [Chem D x Afghani]),Dawg's Waltz,East Coast of the United States,"If raw potency is what you desire, the Waltz will certainly scratch that itch, hitting hard immediately and not letting up for a solid 2 to 3 hours, even catching veteran users by surprise with its complete package of effects.  An immediate burst of warmth and pressure in the eyes and a fiercely vibrating body effect blends perfectly and helps the user relax but also fills them with a strange cerebral energy which is conducive to sedentary activities and projects as well as socialization.  The initial 30 minutes to 1 hour period of effects feel like a true hybrid, with just enough Sativa influence to keep the mind active and the mood high — however, the Indica side of things normally takes over past that point, making the mental state more pensive and relaxed and continuing the loose, massaged feeling throughout the body.","Bred by ""High & Lonesome"" (aka H&L), this strain is fairly new (circa 2009) and though it originated on the East Coast, it is quickly gaining a reputation for its potency and incredible smell through the medical marijuana dispensaries of Colorado and California.  The strain is named after a David Grisman song of the same name.  The so-called ""Poodle Nuts"" cut is the most prized and was selected and spread by a grower known as ""forty"".",Indica-dominant hybrid

This was among the cleanest-smelling strains we've had, absolutely floral and something we could smell all day, even though it wasn't all that pungent until it was broken into.","One reviewer loved this strain and forgave its lack of blinding potency, but the other reviewers felt that it just wasn't potent enough to warrant an A-level grade. Visual appeal for this one was very high, with an array of beautiful colors and tons of sparkling trichomes that were harvested at the proper time. The smell and taste package were perfect for the strain lineage, and they seemed to match for the most part, which is always appreciated. The clean, heady, and energetic effects were perfect for any daytime use, and there were no physical signs of being medicated… good strain for professional situations.

It seems the time of day and situation might play a larger role in the effects of this med than some others — the energetic one was a mid-day review when the reviewer had things to do, and he functioned well. The others were in the morning and later at night when both reviewers were not busy, so the heavy effects seemed to come through harder.

Top-notch aroma here, one that Trainwreck and Haze lovers especially will enjoy.","Regardless of expectations going in, this strain had very high marks in all areas, with the smell and appearance especially drawing our attention. We definitely think that this is daytime medicine, as the mental and physical stimulation it gave would likely keep a patient awake at night with mind racing. We actually liked a lower dosage of this strain in terms of daily use, as the psychedelic elements we experienced at high dosages made it less functional both mentally and socially — but those adventurous 'psychonaut' types among the MMJ patient population will likely enjoy those elements of the experience.","After the world-class aroma experience, it's hard not to be slightly disappointed with the flavor, but this one held up very well. The flavor was a little more OG-tinged than the smell was, giving hints of the pine cleaner type of sharpness combined with a hint of the floral Haze sweetness.

Multiple reviewers reported quite a lot of borderline psychedelic activity, including slight auditory and visual hallucinations and at times felt a bit of sensory overload.

While not outwardly pungent like something in the Diesel/Kush family, it was a strong and bold aroma nonetheless.","Though it won a Cannabis Cup way back in 1994, we didn't expect a whole lot from this strain, simply because it's very old-school and contains strains that make our collective shoulders shrug. However, this strain showed us that old Dutch seedbank material has its good points, as it provided a great Sativa-hybrid experience and a huge dose of fresh, sweet, fruity notes in both the flavor and the aroma. This particular grow was mostly without flaw, and we especially liked seeing the array of cloudy trichomes, which seems increasingly rare (we often see a bunch of clear heads with patches of ambers mixed in rather than a true progression). While its strong start and at times racy effect may get on top of some inexperienced patients, it was moderately potent overall and would be suitable for daytime relief for mid-to-experienced patients. This is a strong first KindReview for Green Mountain CARE, and we look forward to seeing more choices from their garden.","While it's worth noting that one reviewer didn't seem to care much for the flavor and noted some harshness when burning, the rest of the staff had no such complaints. We got a very fresh, lightly sweet and fruity flavor that seemed to match the pre-grind smell for the most part. It had notes of eucalyptus, citrus, and flowers on the initial hits but burned away into more of a lightly spicy (yet still sweet) flavor that brought to mind cinnamon. The smoke was extremely smooth for the majority of the staff (one using a glass pipe, one using an IncrediBowl) and coughing was minimal. The final ash finished with some dark areas, indicating that a longer or more thorough flush would have been beneficial… that didn't affect the flavor much in our estimation, however.",NaN,Seed,NaN,Early Pearl x Skunk #1 x Northern Lights #5,Silver Pearl,Netherlands,"The effects of this strain were noticed almost immediately after exhaling, with the usual package of Sativa pressure effects rising up into our heads. A fluttery, light feeling in the torso area and an major uptick in both mood and mental activity also added to the Sativa start we experienced. It bordered on anxious at times, but its background body relaxation seemed to help keep us calm and in a positive, borderline euphoric mood. While it was difficult to concentrate on one thing, it seemed to aid with overall mental activity, making some of the staff feel like multi-tasking machines, jumping capably from task to task but never lingering. The fairly excitable state declined in potency after about an hour, then shifted gears at about 1.5 hours to a more relaxing state that lost the at-times anxious edge. The effect's endurance was also somewhat surprising, lasting at a medicinal level for 2 solid hours, then declining quickly from there but lingering in the eyes for a full 3 hours.",Bred by Sensi Seeds to create an easy-to-grow stress-resistant varietal for indoor cultivation,Indica-dominant hybrid

The second half came with some drowsiness, but a quick re-medication would fix that. The crisp Haze-influenced aroma and taste were both pleasing, if a bit indistinct, and we had no real complaint about the appearance.

NaN,"A strong, sweet, and sometimes sour aroma that is of the fruity variety.","Crossed from ho-hum commercial strains (Afghani and Skunk #1), this plant was a bit of a surprise for Gerrit Slot, the owner/founder of Magus Genetics.  The plant shows some Sativa-dominant traits such as its high calyx-to-leaf ratio, its stretch after start of flowering, and its overall ""up"" effects. It's a branchy plant that is easy to manicure due to low amounts of leaves — the finished smell is generally a strong sweet/sour, slightly fruity combo.","A sharp, somewhat hashy taste going in, with a sweet and soft fruitiness on the exhale.  The smoke can be a bit on the harsh and expansive side.","55-60 days, with some requiring slightly longer",Available in seed from Magus Genetics,"Grows well in any medium — suggested grow style is to let the plants veg from seed for ~35 days and then kick them into flower.  There is an outdoor Warlock from Magus called ""Biddy Early"" (Warlock x Early Skunk F2) that took 2nd Prize at the 2003 High times Cannabis Cup for the Sativa category, beating out indoor-grown competition.",Skunk #1 x Afghani,Warlock,"Afghanistan, Colombia, Mexico — bred by Magus Genetics in The Netherlands","A quality hybrid strain, the Warlock starts off with a mixed bag of Sativa effects such as a slightly pounding heart, a heady start, and a bit of anxiety/paranoia.  However, it calmed down rather quickly and provided a relaxing, even body-centric experience that lasted 2+ hours.  It showed benefits in general relaxation, pain relief, and sleep aid towards the end of the experience.","After coming up with the cross out of necessity and discovering how potent the resulting plant was, Gerrit Slot hooked up with the Bluebird, a very popular coffeeshop in Amsterdam — this began to build the following for Warlock.  He essentially stopped breeding experiments with the Warlock at that point and simply kept it going by cloning the mother over and over again.  Eventually the Warlock would used in almost every cross that Magus Genetics offers.",Indica-dominant hybrid
