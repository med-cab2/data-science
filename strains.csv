303 Kush,"For lovers of Bubba Kush, this strain is a must-try, especially for the aroma and taste package, which is potent and reminds us of the best examples of that strain we've ever had. The effect is a little more uplifting and active than Bubba traditionally is, but this 303 still had quality body relaxation properties that made the incredible mood it put us in even more enjoyable.Pre-'98 Bubba Kush x Reservoir ChemDawg IC3Selected by Colorado's Hill Billy (and named for the common telephone area code, 303), originally bred by Zombo.Broad, spade-shaped woodland green calyxes in open, tight clusters, with desert gold to heath red pistils, and above average coverage with very long, thin stalked trichomes with small headsWe were definitely ""wowed"" by the aroma that this Colorado-born cross possessed, as it was extremely pungent and reminded us of some of the best coffee-chocolate Bubbas we've had. There were notes of smokey bourbon, anise, and a backing sharp chemmy quality that came out post-grind, making this one of the most complex aromas we've encountered in some time. If you're a fan of the dank, spicy smells of Bubba Kush, this strain will likely surpass most examples of pure Bubba in your mind's eye, as it has in ours.While it was nearly impossible to live up to the aroma, the taste did come close to matching it, though it lost some of the added post-grind complexity and was mostly Bubba in profile. One of the great things about Bubba Kush is the ""greasy"" flavor which seems to coat the mouth and sinuses — this sample was no exception there, and we could taste it lingering for at least a half hour into the review. The smoke had an interesting thin, mentholated quality to it and really didn't give us the urge to cough at all, even on the later hits.One word kept coming up during our reviews of this strain, and that was ""fun"" — this one just really improved our moods almost immediately, making us feel social, extroverted, and creative. It definitely felt Sativa in profile to start, increasing energy and bordering on racy at times (never anxious though), with a heavily buzzing body and pressurized face/eyes. The happy mood and relaxed body which made up the majority of the experience post-30 minutes wasn't conducive to working simply because we wanted to enjoy life more than concentrate on anything. This strain was great for some mind-wandering and following your fancy, so to speak. After the main potency passed around 1.5 hours into the experience, we felt more able to actually relax and concentrate if needed, and the body relaxation feelings increased.ColoradoClone"

A.S.H.,"This A.S.H. is an example of some classic genetic lines in perhaps the ""trinity"" of genetic lines, Afghani, Skunk, and Haze. The blend of these influences could be seen in all areas of the sample, from its structure, to its smell, to the effects. We all enjoyed this strain but saw potential for better medicinal-level duration and better flavor lurking within, namely due to what we see as a slightly early harvest and not-quite thorough enough flush. These flaws didn't do much to dampen the overall experience however, and the mix of uplifting and ground effects from the Afghani and Haze parts of this strain were an enjoyable tug-of-war that ultimately felt like a great hybrid. This is a good strain for those who appreciate the classic taste palate of Skunk and Afghani and desire a daytime mix of Sativa and Indica effects — we felt that the strongly cerebral and slightly rushy start would be a little much for inexperienced patients, especially those who suffer from anxiety or nausea issues.Bred by Mr. Nice SeedbankClaw-shaped fern green sepals in open, loose calyxes, with driftwood brown pisitls, and above average coverage with short, thin stalked trichomes with large headshe staff's consensus favorite part of this sample, the aroma was a very classic-smelling mix of musky, skunky, garlicy, vegetal, and lightly fruity/sweet all at once. The lightly sweet and fruity Afghani musk it broadcasts in the jar is rather pungent, but it increases further when ground and takes on more of the garlic dimension as well, always with the Haze spice in the background.Flavor-wise, this strain was again a mix between the almost putrid, lightly sweet, fruity Afghan and slightly sharper and spicy flavors. We didn't feel that the smell came through to the taste as cleanly as we would have liked, we think this is partly due to the Haze-style bud structure containing a decent amount of leaf cover, which brought added harshness and standard smoke flavor to the party. The thick smoke that results from this one was moderately expansive and did hit the lungs a bit hard, causing some coughing at times. We felt both parts of the lineage on this one pretty clearly, and it almost seemed to run the gambit of Sativa and Indica even between our review staff, with one member reporting heavily Sativa feelings, one somewhere in-between, and one leaning slightly towards the Indica side. The start was clearly Sativa and Hazy in nature, coming on rather strongly to start, but seemingly building over the first 30-45 minutes, filling our heads with pressure, our chests with a fluttery, light, borderline rushy feeling, and a slight loss of vestibular senses (felt like we were moving or spinning at times, especially with eyes closed). It definitely served to wake us up a bit with the potency, but it also cast a bit of a ""sensory blanket"" feeling over everything, and we just felt a little bit mentally slow despite the internal energy. Still, we were able to function in more creative and less detail-minded tasks, and the relaxation feelings increased as it rolled past 1.5 hours. The Afghani body effects seemed to come into play around the same time, serving to bring us back down after a rather 'up' beginning, but it never really made us drowsy or came with the crash we expected. A long, slow decline following the end of medicinal-level effects around 2 hours carried us out to about 3 total.NetherlandsSeed"

Afkansastan,"Like a rollercoaster with a big first drop, this one was strong off the bat and then finished out much calmer. We loved the mixed nature of the high, and it felt almost equal in terms of mental and physical effects. The unexpectedly sweet and fruity taste and smell was a great addition to the effects.

Similar to smell, berries that did not earth out like most sweet ones do, more like it hashed out slightly. Instant and extremely clean relaxed feeling but not the intense crushing indica takeover expected. Body went from tight and anxious to loose and calm with a pulsing from top to back of head.

303 Kush,"For lovers of Bubba Kush, this strain is a must-try, especially for the aroma and taste package, which is potent and reminds us of the best examples of that strain we've ever had. The effect is a little more uplifting and active than Bubba traditionally is, but this 303 still had quality body relaxation properties that made the incredible mood it put us in even more enjoyable.Pre-'98 Bubba Kush x Reservoir ChemDawg IC3Selected by Colorado's Hill Billy (and named for the common telephone area code, 303), originally bred by Zombo.Broad, spade-shaped woodland green calyxes in open, tight clusters, with desert gold to heath red pistils, and above average coverage with very long, thin stalked trichomes with small headsWe were definitely ""wowed"" by the aroma that this Colorado-born cross possessed, as it was extremely pungent and reminded us of some of the best coffee-chocolate Bubbas we've had. There were notes of smokey bourbon, anise, and a backing sharp chemmy quality that came out post-grind, making this one of the most complex aromas we've encountered in some time. If you're a fan of the dank, spicy smells of Bubba Kush, this strain will likely surpass most examples of pure Bubba in your mind's eye, as it has in ours.While it was nearly impossible to live up to the aroma, the taste did come close to matching it, though it lost some of the added post-grind complexity and was mostly Bubba in profile. One of the great things about Bubba Kush is the ""greasy"" flavor which seems to coat the mouth and sinuses — this sample was no exception there, and we could taste it lingering for at least a half hour into the review. The smoke had an interesting thin, mentholated quality to it and really didn't give us the urge to cough at all, even on the later hits.One word kept coming up during our reviews of this strain, and that was ""fun"" — this one just really improved our moods almost immediately, making us feel social, extroverted, and creative. It definitely felt Sativa in profile to start, increasing energy and bordering on racy at times (never anxious though), with a heavily buzzing body and pressurized face/eyes. The happy mood and relaxed body which made up the majority of the experience post-30 minutes wasn't conducive to working simply because we wanted to enjoy life more than concentrate on anything. This strain was great for some mind-wandering and following your fancy, so to speak. After the main potency passed around 1.5 hours into the experience, we felt more able to actually relax and concentrate if needed, and the body relaxation feelings increased.ColoradoClone"

A.S.H.,"This A.S.H. is an example of some classic genetic lines in perhaps the ""trinity"" of genetic lines, Afghani, Skunk, and Haze. The blend of these influences could be seen in all areas of the sample, from its structure, to its smell, to the effects. We all enjoyed this strain but saw potential for better medicinal-level duration and better flavor lurking within, namely due to what we see as a slightly early harvest and not-quite thorough enough flush. These flaws didn't do much to dampen the overall experience however, and the mix of uplifting and ground effects from the Afghani and Haze parts of this strain were an enjoyable tug-of-war that ultimately felt like a great hybrid. This is a good strain for those who appreciate the classic taste palate of Skunk and Afghani and desire a daytime mix of Sativa and Indica effects — we felt that the strongly cerebral and slightly rushy start would be a little much for inexperienced patients, especially those who suffer from anxiety or nausea issues.Bred by Mr. Nice SeedbankClaw-shaped fern green sepals in open, loose calyxes, with driftwood brown pisitls, and above average coverage with short, thin stalked trichomes with large headshe staff's consensus favorite part of this sample, the aroma was a very classic-smelling mix of musky, skunky, garlicy, vegetal, and lightly fruity/sweet all at once. The lightly sweet and fruity Afghani musk it broadcasts in the jar is rather pungent, but it increases further when ground and takes on more of the garlic dimension as well, always with the Haze spice in the background.Flavor-wise, this strain was again a mix between the almost putrid, lightly sweet, fruity Afghan and slightly sharper and spicy flavors. We didn't feel that the smell came through to the taste as cleanly as we would have liked, we think this is partly due to the Haze-style bud structure containing a decent amount of leaf cover, which brought added harshness and standard smoke flavor to the party. The thick smoke that results from this one was moderately expansive and did hit the lungs a bit hard, causing some coughing at times. We felt both parts of the lineage on this one pretty clearly, and it almost seemed to run the gambit of Sativa and Indica even between our review staff, with one member reporting heavily Sativa feelings, one somewhere in-between, and one leaning slightly towards the Indica side. The start was clearly Sativa and Hazy in nature, coming on rather strongly to start, but seemingly building over the first 30-45 minutes, filling our heads with pressure, our chests with a fluttery, light, borderline rushy feeling, and a slight loss of vestibular senses (felt like we were moving or spinning at times, especially with eyes closed). It definitely served to wake us up a bit with the potency, but it also cast a bit of a ""sensory blanket"" feeling over everything, and we just felt a little bit mentally slow despite the internal energy. Still, we were able to function in more creative and less detail-minded tasks, and the relaxation feelings increased as it rolled past 1.5 hours. The Afghani body effects seemed to come into play around the same time, serving to bring us back down after a rather 'up' beginning, but it never really made us drowsy or came with the crash we expected. A long, slow decline following the end of medicinal-level effects around 2 hours carried us out to about 3 total.NetherlandsSeed"
Abusive's OG Kush,"OG KushAbusive's OG (later renamed ""L.A.

Spice-heavy and a bit sweet, often tasting of sandalwood… the Cherry and Cherry-Lime phenotypes are known for matching the taste of their namesake fruits. A balanced experience that changes according to harvest timing (late harvest produces more of an Indica-like, heavy experience), AK-47 is known for being very potent overall.  The Sativa attributes keep it from being too heavy and narcotic, but there's plenty of body effect and relaxation to go around.  Appetite stimulation and muscle relaxation are the main medical properties in our experience.

AK-47 x NL-5,"AK-47 used to be one of those elite strains that made everyone ""ooh"" audibly, but it has been knocked down a tier in the last few years with all the high-grade Kush and Diesel strains especially - this was a good reminder that it's a strain to reckon with, as is the even older Northern Lights #5.  It's very clear why these strains were chosen as a hybrid - it provided a superb blend of hybrid effects that seemed to satisfy a little bit of everything while maintaining its power throughout the duration.  Its smell was extremely unique but unfortunately that didn't translate to the taste, which was only average.  Still though, this old-school blend would make almost anyone happy (literally, it was an instant mood enhancement) and would help patients greatly with almost any disorder that they may have except for very serious pain. While we weren't all that excited by the also-ran nature of the strains that composed this hybrid, this sample really surprised us with its enjoyable experience, especially the effects.Covered in orange-brown pistils, this strain almost had a yellowish hue to it that made it look less appealing than it actually was from afar.  It wasn't exactly covered with tall visible trichs either, so this strain would probably fly a bit under the radar for most people.  But upon magnification, its trichome coverage becomes apparent.This strain unleashed a very unexpected blast of sweetness combined with a cocktail of spices, similar to what one would find in egg nog or mulled wine.  A variety of smooth and sweet smells from cinnamon to cardamom was the dominant aroma.  When it was ground up, it trended a bit more towards the standard citrus side with a vegetal sweetness, which when combined with the initial smell reminded one reviewer of candied orange peels.  Though it won't make you sneeze with its pungency, it was above-average in that regard and could be detected from a few feet away.With  just a hint of the spices that permeated the aroma, this strain tasted mostly of a lightly sweet piney citrus with a bit of hashiness.  The taste was a bit ethereal, as it seemed distinct and fairly strong but then disappeared as quickly as it came, leaving us struggling to describe it in detail.  This strain gave us an incredibly smooth smoke that upgraded the overall taste score simply because it was such an easy and enjoyable smoke despite expanding quite a bit. Immediately after smokin, our reviewers found themselves in a quickly elevated mood and with a super heavy high behind the eyes that felt like they weighed 5 pounds each.  A spacey head and vibrating body were also part of the package, putting our review team in a great mood where they wanted to be as social as possible or pursue creative endeavors.  The body high seemed to move mostly to the feet/legs and filled them with a buzzing energy as it went on - our reviewers were pain-free during the review despite doing a variety of activities.  This was a fairly superb hybrid high that hit on almost every desirable trait of an MMJ experience, with no anxiety, paranoia, or other negativity.ColoradoClone"

Flowers late and long outdoors, but normally speeds up when grown indoors.  The structure has definite Afghani influences, but the flowers tend to be foxtailed with thick, ropey pistils that retain their thickness and prominence when dried.  ATF will take rather strong feeding and produce well.Matanuska Valley of Alaska, strains originally brought from Northern CaliforniaOriginal is clone only, but there are seed versions offered by Sagarmatha, Reeferman, and in the past by Brothers GrimmNormally in the 70 days area, but some can go over 100 days in certain conditions"

Piney sweetness with a hint of Kushy spice that hangs in the back of your throat rather than hitting the tongue at the forefront. Starting off almost rushy at times, the sativa nature definitely comes out early in this cross.  Very strong ocular attention and facial/head pressure made it feel a little overwhelming or bleary at times despite its clear and even-handed mental state.  The relaxed body and thoughtful, philosophical mind-state this strain provides makes this one good for quiet conversations with friends, reading, or being creative.  Overall, it feels like a pretty even hybrid, bringing out more of the indica as it progressed.  Recommended for ocular attention, general relaxation, joint/hand pain, migraine relief, and possible benefits with ADHD/ADD and other attention disorders.

Banana Kush," This smoke can induce mild coughing fits as the expansion stays with you for a minute or two after smoking. It carries a solid potency for a fruity named strain and can be enjoyed sitting or on the go. It has a talkable nature, but also gives a nice introspective experience to the patient. The taste and smell are absolutely captivating, and makes for a really tasty joint to share with a group. Bred by DNA Genetics affiliate Crockett from a Ghost's OG Kush and 1970s Skunk Haze male Yes, it does really smell like bananas, though the strong kush scent will overpower once crushed or ground.  That banana taste lingers in your mouth.

The body relief it provided was great for moderate pain the mental effects were never too strong or uncomfortable. A good middle-of-the-road Indica compromise that won't knock you out but still provided solid relief from daily aches and pains while putting a smile on your face.Bred by Barneys Farm to increase the yield of Soma's New York City DieselIt was almost hard to see the strain underneath all the light strawberry-colored pistils that seemed to cover 90% of the bud's surface. Underneath though, there were a good amount of trichomes, and it was slightly more impressive than to the naked eye.  Mostly sour and citrusy (as is expected with a NYCD cross), this strain was pleasing to the nose and also carried notes of soil along with a slight vegetal sweetness that came out especially after grinding. Lingering sweet & sour palleteThis strain caused immediate warmth and a radiating feeling that coursed throughout the body and face as well as an alternative heaviness and lightness on the chest. Seemingly not able to make up its mind, we vacillated between states of energy and sloth, but felt slightly spaced-out the entire time. The one constant was the relaxed and numbing body high, which kept us pain-free and in a good mood. It was above-average in potency, but never got overwhelming, making this a good choice for almost any level of MMJ patient effects-wise. Definitely an Indica-dominant experience, we were left a bit on the sleepy side after it was over, but it finished clean overall.9-11 Weeks"

Betty Banner,"This strain takes an A+ strain and adds a terrific new kick. The Fort Collins Cough (Northern Lights #5 x Haze #17) was one of this editor's personal favorites while attending CSU in the mid-late 90's because of its potency mixed with clarity. It was always a highly functional sativa hybrid that was only missing an exquisite flavor and scent. The BB#3 brings that to the table with perfection. The only suggestion KindReviews has for this strain is a new name… beauties like this deserve their own calling card!Bred by Delta 9 CaregiversThe coloration was magnificent, greens, oranges, purples, and more. The trichome count was very high and the density was perfect.The Bruce Banner takes over this smell, which is fine with us as it brings forth so many great scents. You will find soft fruit and soil, as well as a common diesel scent with pleasant earth and pine tones.This is perfect in our opinion - a split of taste between the fruit/diesel of the strain itself and the organic matter it derived life from.Initial soaring effect, very potent characteristics for mind, head, body core and extremeties. There is no missing the onslaught of medicine from every angle and most patients will take 5 minutes to gather their bearings. You will then notice the sativa activity as you get an energy rush and mental euphoria. The indica traits keep the shoulders and back relaxed even as the sativa continues to deliver. This is strong medicine.ColoradoClone Only"

Big Wreck,"Big Bud is known to be a weaker strain that many growers use to up the yields of more interesting strains, yet this Big Wreck is very potent. Indicas are so good for pain and relaxation, and when you find one that still allows for mild conversation it is a real plus. New patients should go slow when medicating, don't smoke a whole joint or you will find yourself with unprovoked guilt and paranoia.Trainwreck x California Big BudVery fuzzy, light green with amazing trichome count. Mild pungence giving a ""designer soil"" scent.Fresh produce, a mild purple sweetness that stays in the mouth for a while.Fast acting, but also a 10 minute steady rise.

Bio-Diesel,"A very eye-catching sample even though it was dark-colored to the eye, this in-house cross from Denver Relief performed well in all areas. The review staff all thought that this med would be enjoyed by almost anyone, as it provided a nice mixed package of uppy Sativa effects as well as quality pain and tension relief in the body. This thoughtful hybrid seems to offer the best of both worlds. Bred by Denver ReliefHoly foxtails, Batman! These nugs were all weird-shaped and each had at least one columnar foxtail reaching out from the main bud. Also unusual was the purpling, which seemed to affect half of a foxtail but the other part was dark green… unique indeed. Definitely Diesel-dominant, it's a skunky fuely stank that also has some slight citrus notes, as are often found in both of the parent strains. After a grind, more of the light sweetness and citrus came out, pushing the fuel to the background.A slightly sweet and mentholated fuel taste was the dominant one going in, but it left a bit of a pine or hickory-like aftertaste.Tears welling up in the eyes (partly due to coughing) and a near-immediate heart-racing feeling started this one off strong, feeling like a pure Sativa at first. Lots of ocular pressure fluctuations and a definite spacey mental feeling carried it into its peak stage about 25 minutes in, where a detached and slack-jawed mental state collided with mood elevation and physical energy (but no desire to actually get up and do something with it). Two reviewers moved onto a very ""crushed"" state where it was a struggle to stay awake and functional in the world, while another (smaller dosage) didn't report that feeling. So that leads us to believe that the higher dosage may put this into the crushing category… try it out and see which amount works for your body type and needs.ColoradoClone Only"

There was moderate expansion though, and multiple reviewers reported some coughing at the end of the review portion as the smoke became very thick.This strain came on quickly, after 2 or 3 hits it sent a wave of pressure into the eyes and head, and a buzzing sensation in the feet and shoulders. A calming sensation came over our staff, putting the mind at ease, but making us a little slow-witted. It was more suited to stationary activities like watching a movie or (if you can keep your eyes open) reading a book, and we didn't feel the desire to leave the house at all. The effect got somewhat tiring as it progressed, with strong muscle relaxation and heavy eyelids making it easy to go curl up for a nap.

Blackberry Kush," For our reviewers who were experiencing a lot of stomach discomfort, it did wonders for relieving that, and everyone really enjoyed the numbing, relaxed body effects as well. It's definitely a berry-scented strain, but that didn't translate to the taste. Still, the pleasant smoking experience again made up for that shortcoming, making this a perfect selection for patients who need an Indica but don't like the thick, at times cholorophyl-laden (since they generally have more leaf matter) smoke they deliver… ""pleasant"" was the word that kept coming to mind with this one. Though the lineage would suggest a more dense structure than the result shows here, we liked the foxtailed and unpredictable structure. Light green and looking like the DJ Short's Blueberry side of the family, it has brick red pistils and a high calyx-to-leaf ratio.  This sample reminded us both of a purple strain and Blueberry with its slightly musky but sweet berry aroma — we did indeed pick up a Blackberry element to the smell as well. It was more piney and musky pre-grind, but sweetened up quite a bit and got more pungent once handled.Lightly sweet and spicy in the mouth, this strain didn't have a ton of taste to it. The smoke was incredibly smooth and non-expansive though, making this a superb choice for those who don't want to cough.  With only a little ear tickle and some face/head pressure to start, this one came on rather slowly and built into a uniquely relaxing body-centric experience within 45 minutes. With a lot of downward inertia serving to pull us into the couch, the warming and relaxing body effects came with very little mental effect other than a pleasant sense of relaxation (mental processes were clear). As time moved slowly forward, the numbing and tingly body effects kept up at a high level, especially in the hands and arms. One effect that we all noticed was strong relief of stomach issues and increase in appetite, which came on almost immediately. As it subsided, we were generally a little tired and this med would definitely pave the way for a restful night of sleep. CaliforniaClone Only"

Blue Cheese,"Bred by Barney's Farm by pollinating a Big Buddha Cheese female with a pair of Blueberry malesCompact, purple-tinged flowers with average resin coverage The high point of this strain for sure, the aroma was a wonderfully pungent mix of sweet blueberry and sharp, musky, putrid elements… which, yes, can be described as smelling like cheese. It's a very strange and unique taste that you really only find in Cheese strains — alternately appealing and revolting, like many fine cheeses  The taste took on more of the cheese elements than the smell did, while the berry sweetness fell to the background. One reviewer commented that there was even an iron/mineral-like taste, similar to what is found in very ""goaty"" cheeses, while others mainly picked up on peppery, sharp notes. The sweetness was still present, but the sharp tastes were stronger for sure. We had one outlier reviewer in our results that had a very uppy, motivational experience full of energy, exaggerated hand motions, and laughter… this contrasted with the experiences of the other reviewers yet was repeated on a secondary review, so we felt it worth mentioning. Sometimes meds simply affect people differently, so keep that in mind with this one, as we don't normally have one review sticking out so much from the others.The majority of staff felt that this was a wonderful relaxing med that served to take all the troubles and pains of the day and put the brakes on them. Starting off with a buzzing, warm body, strong forehead/temple pressure, and an immediate mood elevation, this strain felt really potent early on. It was a torquey med that stayed at medicinal levels for around 1.5 hours, only tailing off around hour 2. The dominant state was one of engaged but inactive focus, where the couch and a movie or video games were the perfect accompaniment. It was a great ""stealth med"" though, as the reviewer's physical appearance was unaffected despite the potency. A soft drop (or perhaps a rise, since it was a ""down"" med overall) back to sobriety made this a smooth experience overall.NetherlandsSeed8-9 Weeks"

If you like a sweet, fruity strain, this one's right up your alley. It's very nicely pungent as well, one of the stronger-smelling fruit varieties we've had in some time.While not quite as pungent and overwhelmingly sweet as the smell, the taste still had a clear berry flavor with hints of earth, flowers, and vegetation. It wasn't a particularly enduring or pungent taste, but was enjoyed by the staff. The staff unanimously agreed that the smoke was very smooth and not too expansive, making this a good choice for patients who don't wish to cough or otherwise have respiratory issues. The final ash was a little iffy-looking, with a charcoal/gray mix, indicating that it may have needed a more thorough flush.A rush of heat to the face and eyes started things off, with an accompanying relaxation and warmth coming over the body as well. The eyes and cheeks especially felt the effects of this medicine, though it didn't seem to physically affect them, as they were mostly clear and wide open. It showed some mood elevation properties in our review staff but was not euphoric by any means — it seemed to be a measured positivity that depended a bit on the incoming mood. The dominant feeling on this med was that of worry-free relaxation with a definite couchlock/lazy quality to it. This would be a good choice for a lazy day or an evening, though it wasn't so strong and lethargic to make it tough for daytime/busy use… we could focus when necessary.Clone Only"

Blue Kush,"It's somewhat rare that a strain's qualities live up to its name in all areas, but this was certainly one of those. This was our first experience with Blue Kush and we all found it to be extremely enjoyable, exotic, and something we'd all happily go out and buy. The appearance, smell, and taste were like the two strains were combined in a lab — perfect fusion of sweet fruitiness and Kush spiciness and elements of each strain's structure. We found this strain to be very relaxing and medicinal without being overbearing or sending us into a withdrawn, sleepy state like many Indicas can do. Perfect daytime (or evening really) Indica relief, though complicated tasks might rub you the wrong way when you really just want to enjoy the strain's comforting body effects.Bred by Dinafem SeedsArrowhead-shaped cucumber sepals with seaweed green accents, tight clustered calyxes, with cumin-colored pisitls, and above average coverage with short, thick-stalked trichomes with average headsThe fusion of Blue and Kush stood out in the aroma, with the pre-grind smell presenting more of a piney Kush quality, while the post-grind smell unleashed a wonderful sweet and sour berry. This one seemed to change almost at random — you smell it one moment and it's all sweet berry, but the next it has clear Kush spice notes — this is a complex and engaging strain with a great pungency level.Though it was less pungent and more ethereal than the aroma, the taste was much the same and continued the perfect match of Blue and Kush. We again noticed that the flavor seemed to shift and mutate as we burned away the sample, at times being sweet berry, at times sour berry, and sometimes all Kushy spice. We all enjoyed how the flavor changed and the overall complexity, as well as the endurance.The effects built smoothly over the initial 5 minutes or so, resulting in a mentally alert yet strongly medicated state where the body felt very relaxed and warm. We kept calling this one ""expansive"", as it seemed to improve our mood as well as gave us a floaty, pulsing body that felt as it was growing from within. Social and positive, we were reaching out for company but kept gravitating towards more relaxing and less-technical activities that allowed time for contemplation and respite. This even-handed and smooth state continued at a high level for a full 2 hours, which is a longer medicinal-level staying power than most — the effect declined rather quickly at approximately 2.5 hours and lingered out to 3.SpainSeed55-62 Days"

Blueberry,"Blueberry [Thai Sativa (Oregon Purple & Juicy Fruit) x Afghan Indica]Pretty stereotypical Blueberry — bright calyxes, dark green leaves, and orange pistils. Average in almost every sense, it was dense enough to be substantial, dry enough to burn well, and covered in a moderately dense layer of trichs. Yep, this is Blueberry… this sample had that perfect sugar-coated muffin smell and was rather pungent both pre and post-grind. After the grind, a slightly musky and putrid sweetness came out, taking over for some of the sugary berry. Simply put, if you like Blueberry, you'll love this smell.A tad disappointing after the sugary bouquet, the taste was a little more subdued, with only one reviewer getting the beautiful candy berry/muffin type taste out of it. It seems to be in there, but coaxing it out wasn't easy for everyone… there was an earthy element to it as well that came out in later hits. Rather smooth and not particularly expansive, this one was an easy smoke.A very smooth and linear experience overall, this strain started off with some light Sativa effects such as eye/face/temple pressure fluctuations, but also immediate relief in the neck and shoulder blade area. With elevated moods, this med took us on a relaxing ride that left us feeling capable the entire time and never overly medicated or fuzzy. While it was more prone to sitting activities, the muscle relaxation and pain relief made active ones enjoyable as well. A strangely enduring face feeling persisted well into the 2nd hour, and the eyes seemed to get redder as the experience went along rather than vice-versa, as is normally the case."

(Big Sur Holy x Afghani) x Hanis (Kunduz Afghani purple pheno x [Pre-'98 Bubba Kush x 1994 Positronics Haze])This strain was created by master breeder Tierra Rojo (of New House Seeds) during the summer of 2010.  The Ft. Collins S.A.G.E. mother is a very Sativa-leaning phenotype of that strain, finishing around 11-12 weeks and producing massive, bract-stacking colas — that cut was intentionally pollinated in early flowering by a Hanis plant which threw a couple of male flowers after being stressed late in flower due to hard flushing.  The resulting pollen only managed to produce a scant 6 seeds in the S.A.G.E. mother, only one of which was planted.  The rest of the seeds from this original cross have been lost to history, but the spectacular seed that was planted has hung around in clone form, being held tightly by a very select few in the Colorado area.  The name of the strain came from a sloppily-written plant tag which appeared to read ""SAGET"" rather than ""SAGE x"" and just stuck because everyone thought it was funny.Bob is great for very mind-engaging activities such as creative tasks or video games (easy to get ""in the zone"" with either one) but not quite as great for conversations, as the mind-racing going on inside the head often overrides the conversation with others.  As it winds down, the mind becomes a little slower and a soft cloudiness sets in, while the body also seems to relax from the near-frenzy of activity which constitutes the first hour of effects.Bob Saget is an almost otherworldly-looking plant, taking strongly after both the 1994 Positronics Haze and the Ft. Collins S.A.G.E. with its large bracts and lack of leaf coverage — it often grows in stacking columns of bracts with an outstanding coating of trichomes, which appear to grow in cornrow-like formations, often fitting together much like the teeth of a zipper.  The plant is normally a greyish green color, but takes on tones of the Hanis' rich purple as it finishes, at times coming out almost entirely purple-gray in color thanks to the trichome coverage.  What little leaf matter is present on The Bob is practically shrouded in trichomes, including the undersides of leaf surfaces, which are featured in the photo album above.Perhaps the Bob Saget's most signature trait, the aroma certainly takes most strongly after the Hanis ""father"" plant, blending a complex, sharp chemical scent which almost resembles acetone with a slight sweetness.  The initial inhale tends to bring more of the sweetness, but as the buds are broken apart, the acrid paint thinner side comes out very strongly, tingling the nose like few strains can.  The Bob (like Hanis) is almost not recognizable as cannabis scent-wise because it is so strange and unique.Much like the aroma, the flavor at first has hints of sweetness and a unique floral element, but the aftertaste which lingers on the palate and in the throat (similar to Bubba Kush or Flo) is all Hanis superglue-chocolate funk.Bob is an interesting Sativa in that it has such a strong Indica influence genetically, but the plant itself is extremely Sativa in growth pattern.  This dichotomy shows in the effects, which start off very Hazy, cerebral, visual, and energetic, and then covert into a stoney, sedate, mind-wandering state that borders upon a ""crash"" later in the duration.  Bob is one of those strains that you can smoke again an hour later and get right back to where you were, and the ceiling is rather high as well, with little tolerance buildup due to regular use.  Due to the relaxing second half, it's normally best as an early evening strain, though smoking on it all day will keep the user's mind active and stave off the typical Sativa crash which often comes as the 2nd hour of effects approaches.Bob flourishes in coco coir with a well-aerated mix (coco-perlite sandwiches, for example) and relatively heavy feeding.  The plant stretches a fair amount when kicked into flower, but isn't one that will get so tall it falls over under its own weight or anything.  SCROG or similar training is recommended to maximize yield, and heavy feedings early will set a solid foundation for lots of bract growth and a more dense structure.  Moderate to light organic feeding normally results in a fairly airy plant, but one with an incredible aroma and flavor, as well as some of the largest individual bracts you will see on cannabis.Denver, Colorado, USAClone-only, one-off creation by Tierra Rojo9-10 weeks, depending on effect desired"
Bogglegum,"As with many of the high-THC% samples we've had, it seems that the potency mostly translates into a longer duration rather than a ""woah!"" type of experience to start — this Bogglegum carried on for a very long time (especially at higher doses) and held its potency at an above-average level for quite a while. If the peak potency were a little higher, it would've been an easy A, but it just didn't grab all of our review staff with its effects, which were mostly just base relaxation and a slight uptick in cerebral activity. The grow was nearly flawless, the sample was rather beautiful, the smell and taste both were above-average and enjoyable… it was just one of those strains that might never get into the upper-echelon of modern medical cannabis, as this seems to be pretty much its genetic potential. Try it out if you like a fairly functional Indica with a sweet soil taste that holds its potency for a long time — it's recommended most for intermediate patients.Bred by Bushy Old Grower (aka BOG)This Bogglegum was totally loaded with fat-headed trichomes that seemed to hit just about perfect harvest timing, with plenty of visible ambers. The frosty appearance made the buds look almost white in the hand, broken up by occasional darker green leaves and red/orange/yellow pistils.A sugary, slightly creamy sweetness is the main bag/jar smell, and we can definitely see where the bubble gum comes into play. After grinding, a most robust and musky smell comes out, with notes of soil, earth, and vegetation overtaking the sweetness for the most part. It was an average pungency sample, neither stinking up the room nor going unnoticed.Two reviewers struggled a bit to get a good taste read on this sample, but the one who seemed to get the most picked up on a taste that was very much similar to the smell, namely a soil-dominant attack, followed by a sugary, floral, sweet quality that lingered on the tongue and in the throat. Though the taste was great, it was a bit elusive — still, the smoke was extremely smooth yet expansive.This was a fairly cerebral Indica, keeping us mentally aware the entire time despite being rather strong overall and flirting with overwhelming feelings at its peak. Concentration on only one subject was difficult at times, but our thought processes were clear and vivid throughout the experience. The initial onset came on heavy, with a warming sensation throughout the body and head/eyes and a buzzing headband-like feeling — we all thought our eyes would be red and low, but they were relatively open and clear… good ""stealth"" med. The Bogglegum seemed to have a mood stabilization effect with us, keeping the mindstate even-handed and calm. The body relaxation carried on well into the latter part of the duration, and overall this med held onto its potency better than most, lingering into hour #3.CaliforniaSeed"

Brain OG,"This phenotype of OG Kush is believed to originate in the early 1990s in Southern California. It is perhaps a bagseed of the original OG, also known as Hell's OG or Tahoe OG. Then again, that's just one story on OG out of many legendary fables. Also kown as Snoop's OG, this particlular phenotype is thought to originate in the mid 90's amongst the proliferation of West Coast hip hop.

Bruce Brainer,"Part of the ""Banner Collection"" bred by Green Dream Health Services in Boulder, Colorado.  The goal of this cross was to bring back some of the more true OG funk taste and smell while maintaining the Bruce Banner potency and increased yield.  Having received the coveted Brain OG (aka Snoop's OG or Soul Assassin's OG) from a long-time friend of Snoop Dog in late 2012, the Green Dream founders knew immediately it was a top candidate for the Banner Collection project.The structure of the live plant is very OG dominant, stretching and producing relatively few flowering sites per foot of vertical growth.  While the growth is all OG, the flowers themselves are more conical and spear shaped like the Bruce Banner nugs. Large OG calyx/sepal structure remains, as the pictures clearly show.Lemon, pine dominant.  The Bruce Banner comes through in the dried flower, presenting an earthy mineral component similar to the city after a fresh rain on the pavement.Very lemon kush dominant, with undertones of earthy soil and minerals.Hybrid natured with an intense potency from the Bruce Banner #3, the Brainer, as it's often referred to, brings the standard OG body high and laid back head but also adds a good hour or more of a traditional sativa experience as far as energy and vibrance go.Any system works but this plant loves height and performs well even at the 6+ feet level.Green Dream Health Services - Boulder, ColoradoClone-Only cuts around.  Seed stock exists but is not for sale.62-69 days"

Bubba Kush,"Its specific leaf structure, stem thickness, density of flower sites and limited node spacing, and dark hues make Bubba Kush stand out in any garden. Specifically speaking, it's known for large bud structures with hues ranging from purple to green.Unknown: [Likely old world semi-arid mountain region]Katsu Bubba - orgnkid was the first to bring Bubba online that we ever saw. That was around 2000/2001 at cw. he was touting it, showing fat stacks of cash, his grows, etc. As far as we've been told, he sold a cut of Bubba to GCM and GCM sold it to Katsu. That is the Katsu cut, aka, orgnkid's green phenotype. Orgnkid first obtained this Bubba around 2000/2001 and got the OG slightly thereafter. Mint Bubba S1- ECK06's s1 phenotype from the first batch of Bubba Kush s1's orgnkid posted to the bay. Purple Bubba S1 - This is a cut orgnkid scored from a SFV club owner that was an s1 of the original Bubba cut the owner of the club sourced (whichever that is). The club owner was scared of the dudes he got it from and knew not to break their rules. But there was a way around it so he could make cuts and buds available to his club. So he makes some s1 seeds from the Bubba, pulls out the yielding, club nugget purple Bubba pheno. Now he has an ""unheld"" cut of the Bubba. THE REAL PRE-98/PRE2K1 - in 2004/5 or so we obtained the above purple and green bubbas from orgnkid through a mutual friend. We also got a cutting from our good friend in norcal (the true pre98). So, for the sake of everyone online that had different cuts back then, we put some info in a Bubba thread much like this one where we grew all three of them side by side and compared. We labeled the orgnkid/katsu the GREEN PHENO/2k1. We labeled the ClubS1 the PURPLE PHENO/2k1. And we labeled the Norcal one, pre2k1, because at that time, we hadn't asked our buddy ALL the info on the norcal cut.. And we were told orgnkid's were obtained in 2k1. So anyways, after a few more pages in that thread at CW, people started getting the pre98 moniker from the kalimist mixed up with the pre2k1 bubba designation. So after probing our friend, he told us he got it from a glassblower in socal around 1998. After posting that, the pre2k1 pretty much started getting called the pre98. The pre-98 is shabud's cut. Swerve's Pre-98 - We don't know where swerve obtained this cut, you would have to ask him. But he has told us that he termed his ""pre98"" because the cut he obtained, reminded him of the the Bubba he was smoking in 1998-2000 in SFV.Bubba Kush is a strain with a thousand stories behind it. While not as 'lore-intensive as an OG Kush, Bubba Kush tends to bring about heated conversations across the cannabis world.While we've had the opportunity to speak with ""Bubba/Matt"" who tells a tale that stems from connections in Florida and ties the Bubba to OG heritage (Triangle to OG bagseeds), we've come to understand that its true genetic orgins are unknown.Very thick flowers ranging from dark black and purple to green depending on the ""cut"" of this strain.  Remaining constant, Bubba produces Kush style cannabis flowers leaning from golf balls to swollen hearts in shape.The aroma of Bubba Kush is one of those unique scents you will never forget.

From hints of coffee to dirty feet, Bubba Kush hits the nose a bit differently for everyone.Depending on the pheno you may receive chocolate notes to ammonia notes, but regardless the smoke with be thick and heavy.  Flavors range on the earthy and bodily spectrum (yes, gross for food but lovely for cannabis) and well grown Bubba should provide flavor through water and the end of the bowl.Heavily narcotic effects, with the Katsu cut being a bit less sleep inducing although still a very heavy body high.Grows well in all mediums but veges very slowly.Hindu/Pakistani origins but west coast USAClone-only, though some have selfed and made seed lines.  The only worth having are clone-only cuts.8 Weeks on Average"
Bubba Kush S1,"With its long list of medicinal properties, its very good duration, and solid overall potency, this Bubba Kush S1 comes highly recommended for patients seeking a relaxing Indica experience that keeps you mentally clear and capable, even energetic at times. The grow quality was very high, with no visible flaws aside from the loose manicure, a great selection of colors, and plenty of well-timed trichomes. While we didn't like the super-sharp smell and taste quite as much as we do the more standard Bubba, it was certainly unique and served to mark this S1 variant as distinct from its parent. If you're a fan of Bubbas, be sure to give this one a try, both because it provides many of the qualities you know and love, but also because it adds something a little different to the equation.The Bubba Kush has been released in self-pollinated, feminized form by multiple seed breeders, including Cali Connection and Riot Seeds.blend of dark green, purple, and those distinctive brick red thin pistils, but it had a sort of primordial, prehistoric look blend of dark green, purple, and those distinctive brick red thin pistils, with big, dark water leaves giving a primordial, prehistoric look to the flower. Trichome coverage is above average, on long average width stems with extremely large heads.Though not exactly appealing in the sense that we want our houses to smell like it, this Bubba was certainly impressive and pungent. It gave off a very strong acrid smell that reminded us of other Bubbas at times, but that classic scent stayed more in the background… the main smells reminded us of a tire shop, fuel, glue, and musk, all very acrid once it was ground or broken up. Pre-grind it was more classic Bubba, with the dark almost coffee-like notes… those nearly disappeared once it was handled.The taste was rather complex, seemingly changing as it cycled through the mouth. Initially it had the sharp rubber + fuel taste from the smell, then once in the mouth it turned sweeter and had more of the traditional Kush notes (spice, citrus)… the finish was spicy, citrus-tinged Kush. The smoke was smooth on the attack but very expansive, so it may cause coughing on bigger hits. The final ash was a speckled very light gray, showing it had a very solid flush before being cut.Our overall experience with this Bubba was one of mental clarity and heavy relaxation. Kushes are known for their mentally-clear effects, and this one was no exception, as we felt completely capable and able to focus despite the Bubba trying to pull us into the couch. The initial effects were an immediate buzzing warmth throughout the body, with a strange relaxed energy and a heavy forehead/eye presence, which felt as if it were hanging over the brow and more weighty than normal. The early effects also came with a rush of thoughts and some visual alterations… in all, a potent start that had one reviewer forgetting about the rest of the bowl. After those early effects died down, a pervading sense of relaxation came over us… there was some couchlock, but overall it wasn't pushy or overwhelming. The comedown had us feeling a bit tired and ready for sleep.CaliforniaSeed56-63 Days"

Cali Connection Bubba Bx2,"A special seed release for the 2010 High Times Amsterdam Cannabis Cup (it was planned as their Indica entry, but there weren't enough dried buds around before the competition to enter officially), this pet project of lead breeder Swerve came about in an attempt to re-create the clone-only legend Bubba Kush in seed form.  An unknown male (possibly Swerve's SFV OG Kush F3 which he used for many breeding projects) was used in this double backcross, first pollinating on the mother to create seed, then another male from that population going back to the Bubba mother once more to reinforce her traits.  The resulting plant grows much like the Bubba mom, but some variation in structure (some phenos will have long, slender nugs which is unusual for Bubba) is to be expected.  However, the majority of nugs are the stereoptypical Bubba pine cone/golf ball shape with large calyxes and that signature purple-gray coloration coming on as harvest approaches.Pre-'98 Bubba Kush BX2Swerve planned this as his 2010 Indica entry for the Amsterdam Cup but was not able to get the nugs ready in time for the festival, so he simply did a special seed release instead.(samples pictured from Beyond Broadway and are sold there as ""D.I.A."" — this strain was also featured in February 2012's KUSH Magazine Strain of the Month.Deep coloration that looks almost gray from a distance is this strain's trademark, and the deep Bubba roots are seen clearly in all aspects of appearance other than the more slender, elongated nug shape which appears in certain phenotypes.  Trichome coverage is excellent, and it appears that this strain would make some high-yielding and quality extracts, judging from the copious amount of trichomes all over the leaf surfaces.A creamy, slightly sweet coffee-kissed aroma with a herby edge is the primary one while the strain sits undisturbed in a bag or jar.  However, when it's ground up, the coffee/chocolate comes out a lot more, as does the musky, herby, hashy backnote which recalls the strain's deeply Afghani/Pakistani origins.Losing some of the sweet qualities from the aroma, the flavor is mostly musky and hashy, with a lingering note of coffee.  Its smoke is moderately thick and moderately expansive, neither sending the patient into coughing fits nor hitting the throat without impact.Taking a few minutes to really kick in, the effects felt predominantly Indica in nature, providing a warming body sensation and pulsing waves which radiated throughout the lower extremities, arms, and torso.  A slowdown of mental activity accompanied by an overall feeling of ease and contentedness overtakes the user after about 15 minutes, leading to a placid, happy, experience that's very smooth in nature.  The eyes get slightly heavy at times (even early on), but the effect never really becomes a ""daywrecker"" to the point where it makes the user fall asleep when they wouldn't otherwise or makes the mind cloudy to the point of losing functionality.  Bubba BX2 helps with both mental and physical relaxation, specifically muscles, but it does so without clouding the mind.  It also aids with minor pain relief, appetite stimulation, and has definite anti-anxiety properties.  Medicinal-level effects last around 1.5 to 2 hours, while the overall effects linger out to nearly 3 hours.Production growers will find that this strain can produce reasonably well in hydro and coco setups.  However, the best flavor normally comes out in a soil grow using light fertilization regimes — the old-school feeding preferences of the original Bubba are intact here, and that means steady but relatively light feedings.  If a better yield is desired, the plants can be effectively SCROG'd, producing a collection of fairly large rock-hard pine cone tops instead of a slightly larger central cola.California, USACali Connection seed release8 to 9 weeks"
Candyland,"Bay Platinum Cookies x Grand Daddy Purple (GDP)This strain was created by Grand Daddy Purp’s Breeding and Development Team out of California. Candyland is a mix of Bay Platinum Cookies and Grand Daddy Purple – two renowned California strains. The mother, Bay Platinum Cookies, is a sativa dominant Cookies cross also created by Grand Daddy Purp genetics. The father is Ken’s proven Grand Daddy Purple male. Candyland can be cultivated both indoors and outdoors. This strain won a gold medal at the 2012 KushCon. The strain is most popular in California and Colorado.Candyland produces tight, dense buds – generally circular in shape but depends on phenotype. The color ranges from shades of green to nearly 100% purple. Buds are coated in beautiful orange hairs and trichomes. The plant itself can be stretchy and viney like many Cookies cuts or short and bushy like the Grand Daddy Purple father.Depending on the phenotype, the smell can range from sweet candy and grapes, to earthy, chemy and fuely – or somewhere in between. The Grand Daddy Purple father is famous for passing along its pronounced grape and berry aromas. The Bay Platinum Cookies mother is known to have that classic Girl Scout Cookies aroma with an added bit of sweetness from the Bay 11.Because this strain is available from both seed and clone, there are a variety of phenotypes floating around. Although specific flavor profiles will vary, Candyland generally has a sweet, musky, fuely smell. It is also known to have earthy undertones. Those growing from seed will have the option to choose their preferred flavor profile – some will lean more towards the Cookies and other will be closer to the Grand Daddy Purple.Candyland is known as a mood enhancer that is good for pain relief, managing muscle tension, and relaxation. The high can be more balanced like a hybrid or more sativa dominant depending on phenotype. Although it can be sativa dominant, it is not known to be racy. With THC levels reaching 19%+, the strain can be very potent. Candyland induces feelings of mental focus while providing relief throughout the body. This strain can be effective in treating depression, pain, anxiety, and ADD.California based genetics (Bay Area)Breeder: Grand Daddy Purp (Ken Estes)This strain is available in both seed and clone form.8-9+ weeks (56-63+ days)"
Captain Kush,"It never was overtly potent and despite lasting a long time, we sort of lost track of the effects at times because they were mild and unobtrusive. In many senses, this is a good thing (this was a pretty clear-headed med suitable for a day of work), but we think that this one is best saved for newer patients and those seeing moderate relief which last a long time but doesn't ever feel pushy.Slender spearhead-shaped wasabi green sepals, tightly opened pinecone calyxes, with frequent bursts of saddle brown pisitls, and above average coverage with average-length, thick-stalked hooked trichomes with average headsWhile the aroma wasn't particularly pungent, it did develop a bit when ground up, releasing a crisp, clean, sweet pine-citrus aroma that definitely brought to mind Snowcap and other similar strains (NL #5-Haze, Jack Herer, etc.).Softly sweet and piney, the flavor was fairly similar to the aroma on the first few hits, but declined from there and just because neutral and smokey. It never really tasted bad, but the flavor just disappeared rather quickly — we think that the dryness level may have had a lot to do with the way the flavor declined, as well as the way the smoke tickled the throat. The flush certainly wasn't to blame for any harshness, because the final ash was mostly white with some black flecks, showing a very quality flush prior to harvest. This one ultimately just fell short of its potential.A moderate pulsing throughout the body and limbs was the signal that effects had begun, coming on rather smoothly and creeping up in potency over the first 20-30 minutes. While we didn't really feel much of a change in mental energy or mood, but rather a gentle relaxation which had us able to concentrate on non-interactive activities, but fading out a bit when deep concentration and attention was required. Several members of the staff commented that this med was almost invisible at times throughout the experience — it's certainly not a ""punch in the face"" type of med, but rather a smooth Sativa that kept us between mood elevation and relaxation with no negative effects or abrupt comedown. Some staff were left wanting more peak potency, but the duration was very good, lingering out to over 3 hours for all of our staff.ColoradoClone"

Others claim Cat Piss (NorCal) is closer related to an Afghan landrace with heavy indica effect. Yet another Cat Piss is a Super Silver Haze cross but it is less circulated and unpopular.

Charles' Kush,"Absolutely beautiful in so many ways, Charles' Kush is definitely an incredible herb. The effects caused by this medication are exactly what many people search for in an indica dominant strain. The smoke is super smooth and really thick; like blowing out clouds of Kush. Great bud to leaf ratio, and our samples were extremely well manicured.

Medium green colored packs, with hints of dark-purple. Some phenotypes are known to turn very purple or have stronger odors.Has the pungent smell of kush. The aroma is not as strong as some other strains I had, but still very captivating.Incredibly smooth smoke. Great taste of kush, with a piney after-taste.Hits real fast and feels like it slows time.

Charlotte's Cookies,"Believed to be a Girl Scout Cookies s1 x New Jack City It grows very similar to Girl Scout Cookies, with a slightly more sativa bud structure. The leaves are very jagged and they always have more fingers than the traditional Girl Scout Cookies. Between harvesting and curing, the smell transforms from berries and cream to a profound fake-cheese aroma.

Charlotte's Web,"There is a very interesting back story about the cut available outside of Realm of Caring. It is not technically the famous Charlotte's Web, also known as R4 when it was selected from the Stanley Brothers breeding project. It is actually R5, a sister seed from the same project with the exact same parents. Almost an identical twin, R5 has a very similar growth pattern and cannabinoid spectrum to R4. Hence, it is still called Charlotte's Web just as there are numerous Chem Dawgs, Skunks and other strains that are ordered numerically.Charlotte's Web was made famous by Charlotte Figi, a child who experienced a dramatic decrease in the frequency of her seizures after consuming cannabis oil extracted from this strain. Charlotte's Web grows like a pure Afghan, short and stout with non-fibrous stalks. Ironically, it as far from the traditional hemp sativa structure as you could achieve, but the flowers are still CBD rich.Flowers smell like purple candy Now-and- Laters.This strain has been demonstrated as a nerve protectant and has been used in the treatment of epilepsy in both children and adults.

Cheesel,"Chem 91 x UK CheeseCirca 2009/2010 Sonoma County [Chem 91 x UK Cheese Male(Amsterdam)] Infamous #12 phenoCheesel has a strong cheese fragrance by namesake with diesel fuel overtones. Cheesel tastes very rich and skunky with a heavy bodied smoke that lingers on the tongue after exhaling. Whereas the UK Cheese is noticable more on the aroma, the diesel flavor accents the Chem '91 lineage. Cheesel is an indica dominant hybrid that delivers a rounded effect of dissasociation from the body. Focus is made quite difficult while on this strain and is best used after work or daily responsibilities are through. Sonoma County, California8 weeks"
Chem #4 x Sour Diesel,"One of our veteran staff called this one of his favorites of this year effects-wise, ranking it in the upper echelon of potency and rating both the smell and flavor a 9+. Not all of the staff were quite as enthusiastic about the flavor and smell, but the effects were universally enjoyed for their energetic uplift that only had a tiny edge of anxiety to it early on — great balance of energy and comfort. This was a thoroughly enjoyable medicine, and we felt that it fits best for the daytime, especially a day off when you can really appreciate and indulge in its mind-expanding and mood-elevating effects. One reviewer commented that this was as much a recreational ""fun"" med as a medical one, while another got great relief from back problems and nausea, so it seems to show a versatile nature.Spearhead-shaped pesto green sepals arranged in clustered stacked calyxes, with bursts of dark burgundy pisitls, and supremely covered with above average-length, average-stalked trichomes with large headsPungency was the name of the game here, and this sample was easily-noticed, whether it was sealed in a bag or not. The dank rubber-fuel-skunk front notes has a background of spice and citrus, making for an almost overwhelming scent package before it's even ground up. The post-grind aroma brought to mind a bit more of the Sour Diesel, with a stronger kick of fresh citrus and an almost floral quality once it settled. This strain is one of those that is a matter of personal preference — most of our crew loved it, but it is a challenging scent like most Chem and Diesel strains.The pungent aroma translated directly to the flavor, which again was Chem-dominant, with a Sour Diesel-influenced citrusy finish. Deeply spicy with notes of rubber, skunk, and chemical cleaner on the inhale, the exhale left an almost anise-like flavor on the lips, and a fuely scent in the nostrils. Again, this whole family of strains are a bit of an acquired taste, but Chem and Diesel-lovers will certainly appreciate this example's flavor. White this strain's effects were felt immediately with the increase in face/eye/head pressure and temperature as well as heart rate, we all felt that it was at its peak between 30 minutes and 1 hour into the experience. The time of day seemed to affect the results of the reviews, as the reviewer who sampled the strain at night felt it shift gears around the 1 hour point to a meditative relaxation, while the daytime reviewers got a lasting boost in energy, mood, and physical activity. The surging energy was felt throughout the body and kept us up on our feet, at times pacing around smiling for no reason in particular. It wound down for most of the staff around the 2 - 2.5 hour mark , but left a lasting feeling of energy and focus, unlike some Sativas which give a drained, ""crash"" feeling as they fade out… a worthy ending to an overall very satisfying experience.ColoradoClone"
Chem D x Sour Diesel,"This strain will certainly leave an impression with you… whether it's something you'll come back to is entirely personal preference, because it's definitely not for everyone. Patients who suffer from anxiety, cardiac issues, or cannot handle extremely potent Sativa effects to start may want to steer clear of this one, because it's not to be trifled with. The aroma and appearance both were outstanding, and the flavor was very solid as well — again, the olfactory qualities are an acquired taste, but Diesel and Chem-heads will absolutely love it. while we found some medicinal qualities in this strain (primarily ocular effects and pain distraction due to sheer potency), this one felt like more of a cerebral mind-expander type of strain than anything; truly one for the Sativa-lover who wants to experience raw power.Likely bred by Colorado Alternative Medicine in Denver, COWide spade-shaped clover green sepals arranged in clustered spiral calyxes, snaked through by shocks of mahogany pisitls, and supremely covered with average-length, thin-stalked trichomes with large headsIf aromatic pungency is what you're looking for, this is a great choice. Even from 5 feet away in a sealed baggie, this sample could be smelled, and when it was broken up, it somehow even got more pungent, to the point where it was almost a nose overload and we could only smell it for short bursts. The combination of skunky fuel, gun oil, rubber, hints of citrus, and garlic is something to behold, and really should impress anyone — the catch is whether or not you actually like this acrid and powerful of a scent, which is entirely personal preference.The sour and somehow sweet combination of fuel, chemical pine, citrus, and spice in this one was amazingly tasty on the early hits, leaving a strong lingering flavor in the mouth and sinuses. Beyond those early hits, it was a fuel-spice lingering flavor which never took on negative qualities. It's worth noting that one reviewer reported the qualities of this strain his mouth and sinuses for up to 40 minutes after smoking — it definitely stays with you.Early potency is this strain's calling card, and it absolutely jumped all over us to start, feeling almost like a high-grade extract rather than a strain. Our eyes felt like they were bulging, the forehead felt as it was expanding laterally and outwards, and our entire bodies filled with a fluttery, borderline frantic energy (major increase in heart rate). The energy translated to the mental state as well, which would be a flurry of random thoughts and sensory impressions, but then would seem to blank out, where we'd get lost staring at a random object, etc. Very potent start with this one, and even up to 1 hour we felt it was still almost at its peak effects (all reviewers were 8.75+ in potency rating at that point, very unusual). It was almost disorienting, and we found ourselves 90% immobile despite the frenetic internal energy. Music was something that we all seemed to enjoy at a high level whole reviewing this sample — the mind was expanded and ready to intake a variety of stimuli, but somehow unsure what to do with it all, making it more like pure sensory input with very little back-end processing. Beyond 1 hour, it began to unleash its grip and we were more able to focus on one thing at a time and the at times anxious mood calmed down. This sample did leave us feeling a little drained, as most meds with such a strongly Sativa start tend to do.ColoradoClone"
Chem Dawg,"Chem Dawg is an amazing strain, used for so many other wonderful varieties you are familiar with.  OG Kush, Sour Diesel, etc.  ""Dog Bud"" (unknown) Bagseed (S1/F1)Colorado growers P Bud & Joe Brand were growing a strain they alternately called the ""Dog bud"" (because it was said to make the smoker roll on the ground like a dog), and the ""Chem"" weed (because of its unique almost chemcial funk).  After turning on an East Coaster to the strain on Grateful Dead tour, they stayed in touch, and later sent some herb East to their friend.  In one batch, the recipient found seeds, which would later be known as the Chem line (Chemdog [aka Chem 91], Chem B [aka SistaChem], Chem D, and Chem 4).Most research shows a large fog cloud surrounding all true origins, but once you've smelled ChemDog you know it's a building block in much of what you pick up today.Very light coloration from trichome count.  A great middle road density.Sour, chemical pine, sweet, soil.

ChemDog Bio-Diesel,"This one really impressed us with its raw potency to start, and had one experienced reviewer contemplating if it was the strongest start he's ever had (flowers OR concentrates). That said, the potency may simply be too much for many patients, especially those who are prone to anxiety due to some physical manifestations of this sample such as a racing heart and sweating. Even for our experienced staff, we found ourselves bordering on disoriented and unable to do much of anything for the first hour. The power held within the effects were certainly hinted at with the smell and taste, which were both very pungent and acrid — Diesel and ChemDawg connoisseurs will love the bag appeal of this one.Arrowhead-shaped fern green sepals, arranged in open stacked calyxes, with dispersed small patches of raw umber pisitls, and well above average coverage with long, average-stalked trichomes with large headsIf you're a patient who at all likes the acrid, fuely, skunky end of the cannabis aroma spectrum, this strain will make your day. This is one of the strongest-smelling strains we've encountered in some time, both in overall pungency (both pre and post-grind) and in terms of the ""impact"" the smell has on the nostrils. Fuel, skunk, hickory, garlic, body odor, and just a hint of citrus (after it's ground) are the dominant notes on this one, and ""dominant"" is exactly the right word to use to describe them.While the taste (like the smell) isn't exactly appealing to many people, it certainly is impressive in the same way as the aroma. Thankfully, the acrid skunkiness is toned down in the flavor a bit, with mostly the fuel, spice, and smoky flavors coming through, with the spice lingering as the aftertaste. This one was a very fast starter, coming on almost immediately with strong effects. Most of our staff began sweating and had a very noticeable increase in heart rate, which could really prove to be too much excitement for those who suffer from anxiety issues. Along with the racy internal energy it provided, it sent us into a flurry of random thoughts and ideas, making it hard to concentrate at times, as if the raw ideas received little to no processing prior to entering the mind. In short, we felt rather ""crushed"" and unable to do much of anything, preferring to simply sit (or lie down) and hang on for the ride, at times having our legs fall asleep from sitting in the same position for too long. As it finally began to drop in potency around 1 hour, the effects became more functional and elevating, but not in the traditional happy mood elevation sense, but rather more of a heightened state of sensory awareness and internal energy. The effects continued to dwindle through 2.5 hours, simply lingering on from that point.ColoradoClone"
ChemDog Haze,"Adding some punch to the fairly cerebral Haze, this hybrid is a thoughtful combination of strains that starts off with a bang.ChemDog x Super Silver HazeMale is reported to be Shantibaba-era Green House Super Silver Haze (#7 phenotype?). This cross is different from ""ChemHaze"" aka Dawg Daze, which is Chem D x Sensi '93 NL#5 x Haze Acrid citrus, chemical pine and cleaner — it is normally Haze-dominant, with only some body odor-like funk as a reminder of the ChemDawg mother. Much like the smell but adding a unique ""cool"" eucalyptus and some flowery/soapy notes, it again is Haze-dominant. With a bit of a sledgehammer start, this strain contains a variety of strongly Sativa effects, with the requesite head/eye/face pressure fluctuations, a tingly body, and a slightly rushy edge at times.  Once the initial slam wore off about 1 hour in, it dialed in to a fairly functional and social state that felt mentally clear.  A bit of drowsiness might creep in as the energy leaves, but it's not a total crash.  Recommended primarily as a daytime/early evening  med for energy, mood elevation, ocular issues, and its anti-nausea properties.

ChemDog Haze 1,"The look was simply spectacular, with wonderful structure, texture, solid harvest timing, and that pristine Sativa appearance. The smell matched that Sativa bent, and so did the experience, filling us with a focused energy after a bit of a sledgehammer start. Great for a late day pick-me-up, especially in situations where you need to maintain some semblance of functionality and mental clarity.Chemdog x Super Silver HazeThis sample had some of our favorite type of structure, that wonderful Sativa that isn't fluffy or wispy but still has some space to breathe, letting the long pistils and calyxes all stand out clearly, even from a distance. A healthy light green with orange-brown pistils, and leaving trichomes all over your hands/grinder. This sample screamed Sativa to our staff with its blend of sharp citrus combined with hints of the chemical pine/cleaner aroma common in Haze varieties. One reviewer who grinds samples picked up a hint of a body odor funk after grind, which definitely recalled the ChemDawg parentage… otherwise, it seemed to be pure Haze smell-wise. It had a nicely pungent scent when handled but was not overpowering at all.The first few hits were like flowery lemon soap with hints of the sharp chemical smell bite that was present in the smell. There was an interesting ""cool"" eucalyptus-like quality to the smoke and flavor that offset the sharp citrus notes well. A very potent start with welled-up eyes, forehead pressure, a buzzing feeling all around the skull, and a tingly feeling throughout the body… pure Haze feeling off the bat. The initial potency may be a little much for some patients, as it could trend towards the anxious side at times, especially at higher dosages. It was a 'stealth' med for half of our staff, but left the other half's eyes looking glazed-over and low, so it's a dice roll in professional situations. After the strong start, it backed off into a functional and driven energetic state that was moderately social and very clear-feeling throughout. There were some reports of drowsiness after the 2 hour mark, but it wasn't unanimous and might just depend on context/environment.ColoradoClone"
Chernobyl,"Bred by TGA/Subcool, the female used to breed Chernobyl was from a seed Subcool found in a sample of Trainwreck he got from a grower called Smokescreen.This was the first experience with this strain for most of our crew, and it was thought to be an overall very pleasant experience, suitable for getting some work done or exercising a creative muscle. Its lasting effects with a long linger and very solid initial potency made up for the somewhat lacking taste and smell, which were just not particularly pungent or memorable. The minor grow flaws took this one down a notch, and we'd like to see it in perfect condition… but it was still very nice to look at and provided an easy, enjoyable experience.Claw-shaped dingley green sepals arranged in open stacked calyxes, with bursts of copper pisitls, and average coverage by average-length, thin-stalked trichomes with small headsThis strain had a rather light smell that had a floral citrus quality to it, with some piney sharpness coming out after grinding. It was pleasant but not very pungent, a soft Sativa smell.While one reviewer really liked the flavor of this sample, the majority of us felt it was simply average in the taste area, with a piney citrus flavor that wasn't remarkable. Though it wasn't pungent or overtly flavorful, it was a rather smooth smoke that didn't expand much, making it a good choice for patients who don't wish to cough.Though it started off with a collection of head, eye, and chest pressure effects, we had some divergent opinions depending on which time of day we medicated. One reviewer who medicated early in the morning got a very potent-feeling package of cerebral effects that included some visual and auditory distortions. The other reviewers who medicated later in the day had more of a relaxing experience, with only a slight uptick in physical energy to start and a pervading mental energy that kept up throughout the experience. As it diminished entering 2 hours, a fairly typical ""Sativa crash"" had us feeling a bit groggy but still functional.CaliforniaSeed56-63 Days"

Cherry Kush,"Bred by California wine country breeder, Saint GeorgeThis sample had an interesting red/purple cast to it overall, looking different than most samples from arm's length in the bag/jar and even more unique up close. The Purple Afghani influence can definitely be seen in the coloration, while the structure seemed much like many OG Kush varieties. Trichome coverage was above-average for sure, with quite a few golden and amber-capped trichome heads that were well-preserved. While not overtly pungent, the smell of this sample certainly did remind us a bit of cherries — actual cherries, not the uber-sweet candy conception of cherry. It had twinges of OG Kush acridness (some citrus, musk, and spice), but was overall pretty smooth-smelling and pleasant.There was a faint fruity sweetness mixed in with some mentholated qualities and a bit of spice — overall though, it just had a hashy, smoky quality that wasn't particularly distinct or appealing. The flavor went downhill relatively quickly as well, only really showing itself on the first 2 hits.This was a fairly typical hybrid experience overall, with a Sativa beginning and an even-handed Indica relaxation throughout. To start, it had our eyes feeling flush and full of pressure, some ""headband""-like feelings, and a buzzing presence all over the body. Mentally, there were moments of stupor early on where thoughts were difficult to pull out of their hiding spots, but that seemed to clear up within the first hour, when the effects began their decline. This was a bit of a cerebral ""thinker"" strain, more prone to solitary thought or one-on-one social interaction rather than something like a party. It's not one for focus-heavy work due to its tendency for distraction, but it was relatively functional and clear-headed overall like most OG Kush hybrids. The comedown was a little bit on the tired side, as it seemed to turn into more of a base relaxation experience about 1.5 hours in.CaliforniaClone"

It is a strong cerebral medicine typical of sativas, whereby my body was functioning very well (easily typing and manipulating the keyboard) but I couldn't write anything because my mind was not cooperating. Instead it followed its own thought track, eventually giving way to some indica traits.ColoradoClone"

Pleasant enough, just not pungent or particularly distinct.It tasted of slightly sweet and floral hash — one reviewer picked up on a creaminess that did bring to mind the strain's name. Again, not particularly pungent or distinct, but the smoke was smooth and easy to consume.A numbing Indica feeling crept up on us, gaining in strength over the initial 30 minutes until a pervading warmth and calmness overtook the head and chest area. A bit quiet and reserved initially, it had us feeling extremely mild-mannered and calm, sitting quietly and enjoying the feeling. Once the wave of potency died off around 1:15 into it, it released its hold a bit and we were more social and active, with occasionaly moment of mental haze. We think this would be a good movie Indica or good for sitting around a campfire — aware enough to get sucked into something, but heavily relaxing.NetherlandsSeed51-61 Days"

Cinderella 99,"A squat-growing sativa that has almost pure Haze qualities, Cinderella 99 is truly a gem of cannabis engineering.  It produces a long, thick central colas if left up-topped and has a very high calyx-to-leaf ratio, making it extremely desirable to breeders.  A very good producer as well, it's equally suitable for commercial or connoisseur gardens.  It's been used in countless crosses over the years, and though the original seed stock is thought to be largely extinct, many breeders have created very stable F2 seed stock, allowing this incredible plant's genetic line to live on.'Princess' clone (Sensi Seeds Jack Herer F2) x (Jack Herer x Shiva Skunk), 'cubed' by back-crossing over 3 generations'Princess' was a specially-selected Sensi Jack Herer F2 from the late 90's… a male seed from the same batch of Jack Herer was crossed to a special Shiva Skunk female, producing some male seeds suitable for breeding.  A selected male was crossed with Princess, the product seeds of which were then crossed back to Princess over three generations.  Ideally, Princess was 'cubed' by being bred to her male offspring, producing an extremely stable seed stock that become the legendary Cinderella 99.Varies a bit according to phenotype (there are two main ones — grapefruit and pineapple), but it's generally a sharp and almost putrid citrus/pineapple.  The Brothers Grimm's favorite phenotype was known as the ""evil pineapple"" pheno and has an almost rotten meat quality to the sharp fruity smells. Much like the smell, it seems Haze dominant, with acrid citrus notes as well as some flowery touches.  The flavor depends upon phenotype, with the famous ""evil pineapple"" pheno having a complex rotten fruit flavor with floral hints, and the ""grapefruit"" phenotype is similar to New York City Diesel in flavor profile, with a sharp and musky citrus flavor. Cinderella 99 is known for having a soaring cerebral effect that can be very rushy for some patients.  It's often a ""thinker"" strain, making the mind race at a million miles per hour and even causing visual and auditory distortions.  Recommended most highly for its strong nerve effects, headache relief, appetite stimulation, and energy.  Not really recommended for those with anxiety issues or those seeking sleep aid or deep relaxation… this is a strain which can keep you awake at night due to the uptick in mental activity. Bred for indoor growing, C-99 works well in soil or hydro, but the best flavors are generally realized through soil.  It's a plant that stays relatively short for its sativa-heavy lineage, producing a lot of branches and a long main cola if left untrained.Amsterdam, The NetherlandsOriginally from Brothers Grimm Seed Company, which is now defunct.  Seed versions supposedly from the original BGSC stock are available from Wally Duck, Joey Weed, Dutchgrown Genetics, Gypsy Nirvana, and other breeding houses.Very short for such a heavy sativa, it can reach maturity as early as 45 days after onset of 12/12, with some late ones finishing around 60."
Cinderella 99 x Black Domina,"A great introduction to a Cindarella 99 for people who can't handle the super rushy feelings it can sometimes give, this hybrid has a little bit of something for everyone. The absolutely beautiful trich-laden appearance hinted at the potency that lay in wait, but not the complex interactions of Indica and Sativa going on at all times. The strangely focused and quick movement paired with the calmed and warm body was pretty unique and thoroughly enjoyable. This was a perfectly-grown sample that holds a ton of potential — if the taste can get dialed in a bit better, it will really be something.Cinderella 99 x Black DominaAbsolutely loaded with trichomes (especially the leaf surfaces, which looked white), this sample was an attractive medium strong green with standard orange pistils. It was a rather dense yet slender nug, and it had a little bit of give to it when squeezed rather than breaking apart. Musky almost rotten fruit smell in the jar, but it changes a bit after the grind to a clearly pineapple-tinged scent, but one that was lacking the normal 'bite' that is associated with a Cinderella 99… in all though, very appealing and rather pungent.An ethereal pineapple sweetness hangs at the back of the throat, but other than that, it's mostly just hashy-tasting and not particularly pungent. Though moderately expansive, it wasn't harsh at all, but burned to a mottled gray and black ash, indicating it might've benefited from a more thorough flush.A very direct and focused energy to start, with quick, precise movement and a strong mind-body connection — there was a tendency to feel almost jittery, but that subsided after the first 15 minutes or so. The divergent hybrid nature of this strain was felt immediately, with potent head effects and that lovely warm radiating Afghani body feeling paired throughout the experience. A calm energy with a strong eye presence was the enduring effect of this strain — the Black Domina seems to really calm down the C-99 and keeps the edge off of it that makes many people nervous about C-99. That influence grew stronger as it went on, making this one a bit of an up-then-down experience.ColoradoClone"

Colombian Gold,"We were excited to try this strain, as none of us had ever gotten the chance… it's a piece of cannabis history and formed a key component of the original Sam the Skunkman Skunk #1, which has made its way into countless hybrids over the last 20+ years. Needless to say, we really enjoyed this strain in the ""bag appeal"" areas, but it really shined with its mix of strongly Sativa yet functional effects package that had us feeling motivated, social, and focused. A superb choice as a daytime medication for those who need to be on-point mentally, it packs enough power for veterans at higher dosages, but won't totally overwhelm a newer patient either.Landrace ColombianClassic landrace Colombian strain from the Santa Marta mountain range, released in seed form by World of Seeds BankThe Sativa was evident in its overall light structure, with many super-frosty guard leaves shielding long teardrop calyxes and light camel-colored pistils. Classic look to this one, we really loved the trichome coverage and the overall texture, which was easy to handle and prepare. Some might complain about the lack of density, but this is fine by us, especially in an equatorial Sativa.A blend of slightly musky yet fresh citrus (lemons and limes mainly) with a skunky quality, this strain could well be the template for what many modern Sativa hybrids smell like… it reminded us of so many other strains, most notably Durban Poison (another landrace Sativa). The aroma was nicely pungent both in and out of the jar, but really freshened up and got a lovely tangy quality when ground up.Very interesting tea tree/citronella oil taste, slightly floral and creamy… there was also the lemon/lime tang from the aroma that came through at times. It was a complex and engaging taste, but we really enjoyed how smooth the smoke was… only one reviewer coughed at all, and the expansion was totally manageable.Strongly Sativa to start (like many strains), it hit the eyes and forehead strongly, producing a buzzing feeling and some pressure fluctuations. Alert and active, this sample left us feeling strongly medicated yet totally functional and positive mentally — heads were upright and dialed-in to whatever activity was happening at the moment. Cerebral but not overly racy or frantic at all, this would likely make a good at-work type of strain due to its mental clarity. There was a solid muscle relaxation component that came along with it though, making this a good choice for those who require some relaxation and pain relief with their Sativa strains.

This strain has a truly unique biting yet sweet eucalyptus that attacks immediately when ground up.  In the jar it reminded us of a creamy lime soda or even a gin and tonic, with a definite spiciness that hinted at the G-13 Haze lineage.A rather odd and cool mentholated smoke, this strain wasn't quite as pleasing in this area as it was in the aroma category.  It tickled the throat a bit despite the cool feeling, but produced a sweet-smelling smoke that perfumed the room.  There was a hint of the citrus sweetness, but the menthol sensation overrode it for the most part.Immediately potent, this strain is a big time mood elevator and had us laughing at ourselves a bit as we struggled to get a grip on the first 25 minutes of the experience.  A heavy feeling in the back of the head as well as a warm, pulsing body spoke to the Indica side of this cross, while a strong presence behind the eyes and the giggly mental state were the Sativa contributions to this balanced experience.  While it got a bit heavier and tired as it wore on, it finished cleanly, returning us to a calmed yet aware state.ColoradoSeed"

Cotton Candy Romulan,"Absolutely a great hybrid and one of the best aromas available today. The flavorful taste of the Cotton Candy (or Sweet Tooth) mixed with the great power of Romulan, makes this an ideal medication. An important note to make is that there seems to be no peak of high with this strain, so although the duration could have been better to receive an A, a patient can easily up the dosage to reach desired effects.Romulan x Cotton CandyBred by Federation SeedsNice fluffy flowers with tons of pinkish hairs emerging from the calyxes. Very nice trichome count.The smell is very fragrant. Very sweet like cotton candy (a blue candy smell), with a very pungent skunk odor.Sweet taste of fruity candy. Its thick skunky odor stays in the back of the throat. A nice taste but not very strong compared to the frangrance or other sweet tasting strains.The medicine kicks in real quick and hits the head and body - rising effects for 15 minutes. Gives a wavy feeling across the body, with a strong cerebral high. Makes you very energetic in the mind, but often shuts down the body at the same time.NetherlandsSeed"
Cougar Piss,"The tempermental Catpiss strain made more stable and vigorous by breeding it with an Afghani line.SoCal Catpiss x Afghani #1 IBLCougar Piss is a Colorado-bred strain coming out of Rare Dankness Seeds. The seed line was released over Cannabis Cup weekend and all packs have been purchased and are available for sale in Colorado only.  The lineage of Cougar Piss is SoCal Catpiss crossed with an Afghani IBL (inbred line), making it an Indica-dominant hybrid. The potent and very unique NorCal Catpiss aroma and flavor come through strongly here.  Contrary to popular belief, Catpiss (and this Cougar Piss, which takes most strongly after its mother) actually doesn't smell like ammonia, but has a strangely sharp yet fresh bite that has undertones of sour mango and only carries a hint of its namesake.  The initial taste is much the same as the smell, but the lingering flavor on the palate is actually that of, well, cat urine.  As unpleasant as that may sound, it's a strangely addictive flavor that people who have tried the original Catpiss will remember fondly and pick up immediately in this cross.This is a very potent strain, immediately serving to cast a dulling ""sensory blanket"" over the head and eyes, and making the user feel positive and relaxed, bordering on goofy.  The initial effects are very strong but never anxious or uncomfortable, making it acceptable for those who sometimes struggle with anxiety during the onset of potent strains.  Mental function tends to slow down quite a bit with this strain, and the Afghani lends a strong body heaviness that will tend to keep the user mostly sitting or otherwise relaxing.  ColoradoSeed50-65 days"
Cough x Fire OG x Loompa's Headband,
Coup de Grace,"This is a VERY interesting strain, one that I think has not quite reached its prime. A20 has done a great job so far, simply seeing one of these buds will juice your thoughts. It's obvious they are on the right track, have picked an awesome combination of strains to cross, and most importantly, have a true medicinal focus for the outcome of the Coup de Grace.Bred by A20 Labs in Colorado to treat chronic muscular and joint painBeautiful. In plain sight it appears extremely white/light yellow. These pictures show that there really is a good amount of orange hair throughout. This strain will become very noticeable as it progresses and I have a feeling some folks will believe they are dealing with a ""white"" strain.A nice, strong aroma. While it was familiar I was unable to pick out the individual characteristics of the crosses, confirming this really is its own strain and positioned to grow.The taste got me as an earthy piney taste when I was expecting a more fruity experience. Excellent expansion.Energy based Sativa buzz. Very easy to work and stay motivated, not so easy to watch a movie or relax.ColoradoClone"
Coup d'Etat,"When we got this sample, Dr. Blaze informed us that this was the first real batch ready for the public and that it will be receiving lots of attention and improvements over the coming months. That jives with our experience for sure, as it appeared that this one just didn't quite reach the genetic potential it holds. The Coup mother was one of the nicest in-house creations we've come across, and with the Widow potency, we were expecting a little more of a slam/couchlock experience. But it remained mostly heady (though having GREAT anti-anxiety and solid body relaxation properties), leaving us functional though a little dull-feeling… can't wait to see this one in its completely dialed-in form.Coup de Grace x White Widow MaxBred by A20 Labs in ColoradoNot outwardly as frosty-looking and tight as the sample we received from its mother plant (the Coup de Grace), this one was a little loose in structure, but it made for a pretty striking appearance and left the hands sticky after handling. Dark army greens overall blended with thick ropey orange pistils — the tall, just-on-the-verge-of-ambered trichomes weren't that apparent until under the scope.This sample carried strong notes of peaches and blueberries along with a little of the saccharine sweet you find in Bubblegum strains. An interesting almost liquor-like menthol sweet bite was present as well, with above-average pungency overall.While it was difficult to pick up (one review reported no taste), we were able to notice a floral and ethereal berry sweetness with hints of smokey almost tequila-like flavor. Perhaps due to the tiny seeds, the taste went downhill quickly after the first 2 hitsA warm body and a nearly spinning head started us off with this one, a nice sting of potency right at the beginning that was felt mainly in the head and eyes, which filled up with mild pressure and lasted almost the entire first hour. After that hour had passed, it retreated to a fairly neutral yet relaxed state where mood wasn't necessarily enhanced but not soured either. Mentally relaxed an pain-free, but a little slow and dull-feeling, the latter part of the med did feel more on the Indica side, which we had been waiting for based on the White Widow Max father.ColoradoClone"
Critical Jack,"Despite the long duration, this one didn't stay at peak potency for very long, only feeling strong for 45 minutes or so , then feeling eminently functional and basically scaling down from there until it was barely noticeable at about two and a half hours. That said, the effects were great for all of us and made this a pretty perfect daytime medication no matter the activity… it would be good for creative pursuits, data entry/menial type of work, watching a movie, etc. — anything where sustained attention is desirable would be enhanced by this one. Taste and smell-wise, it pretty much brought the expected Jack Herer bag of smells and tastes, though the smell in particular was top-notch and would be the deciding factor to make us give this strain a try amongst 20 others. This is recommended as a fairly motivational and focused daytime type of med for those who don't need serious pain relief or enduring top-level potency.Bred by DinaFem SeedsThough this sample probably wouldn't stand out in a row of jars full of top shelf strains, it certainly belongs there judging from its coating of well-preserved trichomes and overall healthy appearance.This strain smelled like almost every other top-notch Jack Herer or Jack hybrid (including Jack Flash) and definitely ranked among the top examples we've had in that vein — super fresh and ""cool"" lemon-pine cleaner smell with a wonderful backing floral sweetness that seemed to come out more post-grind. The post-grind smell reminded one reviewer of grenadine — very nice. It wasn't super-pungent mostly due to its Haze nature, but did majorly increase in pungency when ground-up.Not quite as ""Jack-y"" as the smell, the flavor was a little more muted, with some slightly earthy notes at times overpowering the spicy, flowery Haze flavor. The smoke was very smooth and non-expansive, making this a superb choice for patients who don't want to cough when medicating. It burned away to a light gray ash, showing that it had received a proper flush before harvest.This was a very cerebral Sativa, leaving one reviewer staring blankly at the TV for 15 minute stretches and the others feeling rather energetic and motivated by their tasks. The ""staring blankly"" review wasn't due to couchlock or mental sedation, but rather due to the way this strain causes your attention to dial into whatever happens to interest you at the time, an almost unwavering focus. Physically, the strain started with the hallmark Sativa effects such as orbital/eye/head pressure, a slightly buzzing body, and an uptick in both mood and heart rate. There wasn't much of a direct body effect, but we all felt capable and pain-free throughout the experience, able and willing to take on almost any task while also looking the part (very 'stealth' med — no outward physical effects).Seed"
Critical Mass,"We always have a place for moderately potent Indica strains in our lives, and this strain fit that bill perfectly, signaling its Afghani roots in smell, flavor, and effect. Though not overtly potent except right at the beginning, this strain had good ""torque"" and kept up at a fairly high level, declining smoothly over the 2nd half of the duration and leaving behind a relaxed and capable mind. It didn't help with severe pain, but it did really make our bodies feel good, and we like this strain mostly as an evening relaxer for days when a little mental uplift and a few hours on the couch leading into sleep is the perfect recipe.Afghani x Skunk #1 (originally from Mr. Nice Seeds, their version of Sensi's Big Bud)Bred by Mr. Nice SeedbankThin claw-shaped wasabi green sepals with armadillo accents arranged in open spiral calyxes, snaked with shocks of ochre pisitls, and above average coverage by short, thick-stalked trichomes with large headsSlightly earthy, musky, and lightly citrusy smell which limited pungency, even after grindingA base piney, earthy type of profile that was somewhat pungent, but didn't really taste like anything specific of noteworthy. It wasn't just the taste of smoke itself, but was not too far from that point — the Afghani seems to have taken charge in the flavor department for sure, as there was no Dutch Skunk sweetness in it at all. This medicine came on fairly strong to start, hitting behind the eyes and giving a somewhat heavy feeling (like being pulled downwards) throughout the body. An uptick in head pressure and a vibrating/buzzing feeling around the scalp and face made for a relaxing experience, as did the buzzing body. The reviewer who had the largest dosage felt a bit more mentally-stilted than the others, staying in that slightly spacey, stare-at-nothing type of state for much of the first hour. The others reported a less heavy feeling during this period, one that left them able to function if needed, and overall elevating the mood and making for a placid, smiley mood overall. Regardless, the main feelings began to decline around 1 hour, leaving behind either a smooth relaxation, or a deep one, largely depending upon dosage. One reviewer who did the review late fell asleep at the 1.5 hour mark, earlier than normal for him, and awoke feeling wonderful, so we believe there are some sleep aid properties to this one for sure.Netherlands?Seed"

Crystal Gayle,"The appearance of this strain is probably what most people would talk about if forced to choose, as it is truly impressive and beautiful, possessing both great structure as well as trichome coverage. Though we wanted the taste to match the lovely smell, it was adequate and didn't harm the experience in the least — the smoke was very smooth and enjoyable. The area where this strain really shined though was in its initial potency and its long-lasting duration, both of which were top-notch. In previous experience with the Northern Lights used in this cross, that was true of that strain as well — very enduring med that stays at medicinal levels longer than most. The particular brand of functional Indica relief this strain offered will help almost anyone dealing with daily pains and stresses while leaving them able to live their lives capably and handle social and professional situations. This new cross is great for intermediate users but will even impress the connoisseurs with its appearance and staying power.Bred by Grasshopper Wellness in ColoradoThis is a seriously pretty sample, with its tight but not blocks structure, healthy light green coloration, and it's frankly ridiculous coating of trichomes. The working title for this strain, ""Crystal Gayle"" is certainly appropriate, as it shimmers with globe-headed mostly clear trichomes, looking as if it was sprayed with glitter.This strain had a nicely sharp and pungent (both pre and post-grind) citrus cleaner quality to it, even dabbling in the familiar Diesel range at times. It also had some hints of soil (probably the Northern Lights influence) and pine as well, making it a well-rounded spectrum of pleasing aromas.This strain had a middling taste — it certainly wasn't bad, but it just didn't grab us in the way we were expecting after the aroma. It had many of the same elements, they just weren't as strong or noticeable — it was a slightly sweet piney Haze type of flavor with hints of the cleaner sharpness.It mostly seemed to hit the head to start, giving us a buzzing feeling around the crown of the head, a slight increase in eye/brow pressure, some ear ringing, and a bit of a light head. Almost before we noticed, this strain seemed to lift us up off the couch and into a slew of activities requiring a moderate amount of focus — it had moments of slight raciness, but was overall very comfortable. It seemed to be a bit of a ""creeper"", building in effect through 30 minutes, when it had a full compliment of effects including strongly burning eyes. Almost trance-like at times, it had us feeling functional despite being very medicated and relaxed… it managed to retain mental clarity throughout the duration. It didn't seem to do a ton for muscle tension despite the high levels of mental relaxation, but showed great promise with appetite stimulation. A smooth descent where potency cycled on and off in waves finished things off, leaving us feeling aware and peppy by the end.ColoradoClone"

DAK,"Bred in-house by The Health DepotThe sample was covered in a thick carpet of trichomes, and was a pleasing and fairly vibrant collection of greens with orange pistils, structured like many well-grown Sativas; light, but not wispy. The cross of the two parent strains was in full effect here — the Sour Diesel influence was especially evident, as that was the dominant note (fuel, chemical, gun oil)… But very present along with those pungent smells was a fruity, citrus-leaning sweetness with a certain putrid quality to it, much like an overripe pineapple. This was a very pungent and unique sample…While one reviewer got a reasonably strong and very enjoyable taste from this strain, the majority of the crew struggled to get a read on it and weren't that impressed by what they did get. A fleeting, perfume-like sweetness was all the majority reported, but the one who liked it picked up on a floral-leaning citrus sweetness that faded out after about 2 hits, followed by a fuel-tinged aftertaste. This was the area that this strain really shined, providing a near-immediate package of potent effects that got on top of a few of our staff members, surprising them a little bit. Very intense head and eye pressure fluctuations combined with almost mind-numbing potency had us sitting and trying to get our bearings for the first 15 minutes or so. A fairly strong body presence developed during that time as well, with a wave of relaxation and body waves washing over us and making the near-psychedelic effects a little easier to handle. Once the initial burst left us, it calmed down into a relaxed state that still had us feeling some of the head pressure and eye presence into the 3rd hour. This was a very enduring med that kept up medicinal-level effects almost into the 2nd hour.ColoradoClone"
Dawg's Waltz,"Coming out of the breeding projects of a grower known as ""High & Lonesome"", with the blessings of Top Dawg Seeds (the holders of Tres Dawg), this hybrid combines the legendary Purple Urkle clone with JJ-NYC's fiercely potent Tres Dawg, which is essentially a Chem D backcross.  The Urkle imparts its signature coloration and some of its aroma and flavor, but the added sharp chemical kick of the Chem D makes everything more interesting than a standard ""purple"" and make this variety one of the strongest-smelling strains in almost any garden.  Also increased is the potency of the Urkle, making it much more sedative and hard-hitting cerebrally — this strain is best used in the evenings, as it can lead to sleep due to the deep relaxation and strong ocular effects is offers.Purple Urkle x Tres Dawg (Chem D x [Chem D x Afghani])Bred by ""High & Lonesome"" (aka H&L), this strain is fairly new (circa 2009) and though it originated on the East Coast, it is quickly gaining a reputation for its potency and incredible smell through the medical marijuana dispensaries of Colorado and California.  The strain is named after a David Grisman song of the same name.  The so-called ""Poodle Nuts"" cut is the most prized and was selected and spread by a grower known as ""forty"".Dark leaves and purple petioles lend an undoubtedly Indica appearance to the plant overall, and it will often finish completely purple depending upon nutrient regime and temperature.  Most often the finished buds are a robust medium green with bright orange pistils, with mottled purple tinges appearing commonly on the top nugs moreso than the lower buds.  Large, fat calyxes bristle with tall, medium-headed trichomes which pack the surface with a density in the upper echelon of strains.  The buds are most similar to Urkle buds in overall appearance, round and swelled-up with a moderate amount of leaves mixed in.One of the most pungent strains we've ever encountered, the very complex interplay of the Urkle's grape-spice musk and the Tres Dawg's hair-curling Chem-skunk funk will impress anyone who likes an aggressive aroma.  The plant when growing will stink more than 95% of strains and that translates to the final product as well — buds left untouched will exhibit a more soft Purple-tinged aroma, but as soon as they're broken apart, it's deep ChemDawg acridness and skunk-fuel all the way.Falling just shy of the aroma in terms of overall pungency, the Waltz's flavor matches the qualities of the smell perfectly, offering the same blend of fruity-spicy Purple sweetness and overwhelming Chemmy funk.If raw potency is what you desire, the Waltz will certainly scratch that itch, hitting hard immediately and not letting up for a solid 2 to 3 hours, even catching veteran users by surprise with its complete package of effects.  An immediate burst of warmth and pressure in the eyes and a fiercely vibrating body effect blends perfectly and helps the user relax but also fills them with a strange cerebral energy which is conducive to sedentary activities and projects as well as socialization.  The initial 30 minutes to 1 hour period of effects feel like a true hybrid, with just enough Sativa influence to keep the mind active and the mood high — however, the Indica side of things normally takes over past that point, making the mental state more pensive and relaxed and continuing the loose, massaged feeling throughout the body.Though it produces a moderate-to-large yield of rock-hard and large-calyxed buds, the Waltz also produces quite a lot of fan leaves, and fairly aggressive defoliation is suggested in order to maximize yield of lower bud sites.  The plant is a fairly heavy feeder, often requiring additional Cal-Mag through early flower.  It grows rather stout and bushy, with only a small stretch during flowering, mostly fattening up rather than growing upwards.  Taking it on the early side of the harvest window normally results in the best flavor and a more cerebral effect, while allowing some amber trichomes to develop puts this strain squarely on the Indica side of things effects-wise and seems to take some of the sweetness out of the flavor.East Coast of the United StatesLimited seed release, but it's mostly clone-only, with a few different select cuts floating around54 - 60 days"
Deathstar,"A real treat for Diesel-lovers and those seeking a balanced overall experience, this Death Star really did bring the best of both its parent strains. Early Diesel effects subsided into an ultra-relaxing and sedative Indica that carried a variety of medical benefits. The grow quality was top-notch, with no real flaws and a pleasing appearance, smell, and taste. The potency is rather high overall and it lasted a long time, so we'd recommend this mostly to moderate to experienced patients who like an acrid taste spectrum and an up-then-down experience.Bred in 2001-2002 by Team Deathstar in Ohio, the clone began moving through elite circles circa 2004-2005With its strong green and orange coloring, solid structure, and a very nice coating of frost, Death Star haS a classic yet impressive look, made up mostly of large calyxes well-covered in trichomesMaybe the highlight of this strain, the aroma was very pungent, both pre and post-grind. The sour fuel stank carried notes of rubber, menthol, and lemon but also had a strange sweetness lingering in the background. The combination of those smells made this one really noteworthy and impressive to our staff — great choice for Diesel-lovers.Very much like the smell, the taste was a slight sweet Diesel-dominant flavor with hints of citrus and soil and hash. The sweetness was elusive and seemed to come and go, but when the whole package was present, it was top-notch. A building pressure in the eyes and around the back of the head and temples started things off, with an increase in heart rate and some perspiration happening at times. The body started buzzing early on and that kept up throughout the experience, though it turned to more of a warming feeling as it went on. The Indica side of this cross showed up almost out of nowhere, with a couchlocked yet mentally clear and social effect coupled with the warm and relaxed body. This one seemed to depend on mood and time of day a bit, as a large dosage in the evening sent one reviewer to bed unexpectedly, but most daytime reviews were very relaxed but not narcotic or sleep-inducing.OhioClone60-67 Days"

Diesel Krypto,"Very pretty and scoring well in all the bag appeal areas, this strain was totally new to us and provided a balanced Sativa experience that left us feeling positive and fairly functional throughout. Its calming influence went a long way in reducing daily stresses and pains while keeping us fully engaged in the world. The body relaxation likely came from the relatively high CBD ratio for a strain not intended to be a CBD-rich varietal, which was among the highest we've seen — that factor made this strain really feel like a worthwhile hybrid… it's more than just a Sativa. We recommend this to almost any level of patient who seeks mental ease and a positive mood shift while still getting some Indica qualities in the body.A blend of frosty greens with bright orange pistils, this sample was pretty textbook-looking, but we mean that in the best way possible. Super frosty in spots , the nugs were moderately dense and easy to handle. Piney sour citrus, like a fresh grapefruit with a backdrop of skunk and a sweetness that seemed to be overwhelmed by the other smells. Relatively pungent, it pretty much retained its same smell in the jar as when it was ground. Seems to be NYCD-dominant, though lacking the actual Diesel smell.Much like the smell, it was citrus-pine at the front, but the taste had a slightly more acrid quality, edging more towards the ""pine cleaner"" end of the spectrum and losing the subtle sweetness that was present in the smell — rather pungent-tasting overall.Hitting the eyes pretty quickly this strain had us feeling immediately a bit spaced-out and sent our vision into a slight tunnel while also creating a buzzing body energy throughout our limbs and torso. The fairly potent start receded somewhat quickly to a more relaxed state where we felt creative and positive, seeking the company of others and only occasionally fumbling around in conversation. The mood elevation was even and constant throughout the experience — one reviewer noticed quite a lot of muscle relaxation later in the duration, where yawning and stretching felt amazing.

DJ Short's Flo,"Like all of his breeding projects, DJ Short's Flo began with the duo of Thai parents (Flo is Purple Thai-dominant), beefed up and normalized by an Afghani.  There are two main phenotypes for Flo, one that is totally light green (""the Green pheno"") and another that has lots of blue shades in it (""the Blue pheno"").  Though the plant is Sativa-dominant, the Afghan cut down on the flowering time and overall height to make it very suitable for indoor growth.  The most prized Flo variation is often referred to as the ""Temple Flo"" cut and smells like exquisite Nepalese temple hash.Highland Thai, Purple Thai (landrace Chocolate Thai x landrace Oaxacan Gold), and Afghani (one generation-removed landrace from the Pacific Northwest) — these are the basis of nearly all of DJ Short's breeding projects and the Flo is heavy on the Purple Thai and Afghani.See this link for the backstory on several of DJ Short's strains, including Flo.Very distinctive blend of sweet hash, menthol, expensive soil, anise, and some slight fruitiness — Flo's aroma is almost completely distinct and could easily be picked out of a lineup by most experienced users.  It's also known for scenting the room with an almost incense-like smoke once consumed.Much like the smell, it has a cool, creamy mentholated tone to it, with strong soil, menthol, and hash flavors blending into an interestingly harmonious whole. A hybrid in the truest sense, Flo seems to simultaneously be a Sativa and an Indica rather than taking turns, as many strains do.  Relaxing, uplifting, and mentally clear, Flo's effects package are perfect for those looking for some body relief and relaxation but still need to retain functionality.  It's never a super-potent strain to the point of being overwhelming — it's a very even and smooth experience overall that is highly recommended for all levels of patient, primarily as a daytime med. Works well indoors or outdoors in a variety of mediums.  She is a finicky feeder like many of DJ Short's strains and generally likes light nutrient schedules until flowering is really going, when a slight increase is tolerated.  The multi-harvest ability of Flo generally takes 10-14 days to produce the second batch of buds after pruning off the initial ones.  Flo is a medium-sized plant overall and is branchy, making it a good choice for SCROG but not a good choice for SOG applications.Pacific Northwest of the United States, then to AmsterdamDJ Short Seeds, Dutch Passion, and Legends Seeds all sell/sold this in seed form, though there is also the original DJ Short Flo clone floating around as well.55- 62 days"
Dopium,"This rare Diesel-Chem hybrid lives up to its lineage with a hair-curling aroma and an effect which nearly matches the smell in potency.  Though it is a Sativa-dominant variety, it has the tendency at higher dosages to live up to its strain name, giving the user an extremely relaxed, almost narcotic feeling to go along with all the cerebral effects the Diesel and Chem family are known for.Chem's Sister x Sour DieselFound by a grower named ""ToneDawg"", this strain is simply a stellar bagseed.  The cut was passed onto one of the owners at Denver Relief, and it's since become one of their signature varieties.  As far as we're aware, this particular cut is not available for sale in any other dispensary… at least not under this same strain name.As it whittles away, the effect becomes more narcotic and relaxing, giving a bit of the classic Sativa ""crash"" which can send a previously excitable user to bed by the 2nd hour.  The ""up then down"" style of the experience can be mitigated by a smaller dosage, repeated over shorter duration — this will keep the ""up"" side rolling and stave off the sleepy side of the effects.  Overall, Dopium is something we'd call an early evening strain, great for some socializing and fun before a relaxing finish… it aids with energy, appetite, and mood early on, then muscle relaxation, anti-anxiety, and sleep aid properties complete the experience.Lots of bracts vs. leaf coverage on this one, and it has the very dark green leaves and signature pink salmon-colored stigmas of the Sour Diesel side of the lineage, while also occasionally purpling up on the fringes by finish like the Chem's Sister.  The plant gets somewhat tall but will produce a solid yield when let finish through 70 days.  The trichome coverage of this variety again mirrors the parents — it's one of the frostier plants you'll come across in dried nug form.  Most nugs tend to have a fairly loose structure, similar to the Sour Diesel, with tiny dark leaves interspersed with stacking bracts which look almost grey due to the density of trichomes.The complex and pungent bouquet the Dopium offers is certainly Diesel-dominant, with that sharp chemical-fuel-rubber element which so many connoisseurs seek out taking the forefront and practically assaulting the senses.  However, there are some interesting floral and spice notes present which differentiate this cut from other Chem-Diesel hybrids and seem to influence the flavor as well.Less outright acrid than the aroma, the flavor still has strong notes of chemical pine and hickory smoke.  The floral side of things lingers in the aftertaste makes it more palatable for those patients who love Diesel type effects but cannot handle the ""Chem breath"" flavor it often leaves behind… this is a lower key, more measured Chem-Diesel experience.  The smoke is rather expansive without being harsh when well-grown.Immediately heady and cerebral, it normally gives a burst of energy and mental activity early on, filling the user with a desire to laugh and talk.  At higher dosages, it can get a little spacey and cause occasional lapses in concentration, but the good mood and overall energy boost seems to mostly smooth over that aspect of things.  Along with the energy, there is a strong face and eye presence which at times gives the ""headband"" feeling of constriction.  The elevated state of being only lasts for about the first 45 minutes or so, when the timbre of the experience changes to a more sedentary, relaxing one as the strain shifts gears into its decline of effects.Given the genetics, expect a stretch with this cut.  Like most varieties with wide internodal spacing, it's advisable to net or otherwise train the plants so they are not so lanky.Colorado, USAClone only, extremely limited availability70 days"
Double Diesel,"Though we missed the acrid Sour Diesel part of the equation at times, this was a very enjoyable Diesel experience that was neither too heavy nor too light. It felt like a true hybrid, with a blend of Sativa and Indica effects that played well together rather than battling for attention. The appearance was top-notch, with its sound but distinct structure, copious trichome coverage, and lack of flaws. The smell was right up our alley and seemed NYCD-dominant with a grapefuit bent. Overall, we like this med as a daytime or early evening strain for those looking for some mood elevation, relaxation, and appetite stimulation — it's suitable for all levels of patient because it was never too strong but can be enjoyed even by the connoisseurs.A Colorado clone varietyWe all really liked the look of this one, from its foxtailed structure to its impressive trichome coverage. Just a very pretty example of a Diesel strain, with a strong lime green color, and peach pistils.This one had some of the typical diesel notes in the jar/bag before it was ground up, but they seemed to disappear, turning into more of a sweet herby grapefruit… it seemed to be both sweet and musky at the same time, which is certainly unique. It seems that the NYCD dominated the smell department, not much of the acrid, pungent Sour Diesel smell at all… in this case, that wasn't a bad thing.Similar to the smell but much less sweet-tinged, the taste was also a semi-musky citrus with some menthol qualities. It turned a bit more to the earthy/smoky side as it burned away, but overall was rather pleasant the whole way through. One reviewer reported some post-smoking throat burn, but the others felt it was a pretty smooth smoke despite being fairly thick. Pretty average taste overall, which was slightly disappointing after the top-notch aroma.A typical diesel start, with pressure in the sinuses/cheeks/eyes, tickling/ringing in the ears, and a buzzing presence through out the body, at times feeling like butterflies in the stomach. It was never what we'd describe as 'rushy', but it was definitely heady and Sativa in nature to start. As the experience progressed, it seemed to take us to a middle-ground in a manner of ways — mood-wise, energy-wise, and mentally we seemed on an even keel. It had moments of sociability and laughter interspersed with moments of withdrawn silence and introversion. While feeling capable overall, there were also moments of short term memory loss and general slowness. As it faded out, there was some drowsiness, but nothing overwhelming that you can't shake off in the middle of the day.ColoradoClone"
Double Gum,"This strain was so Indica in every way, with its super dense and blocky nug structure, its sweet scent, and its heavy couchlock-inducing effects. While it wasn't our favorite in terms of a daily use medication, it would be great for those days where you want to do nothing but sit around and relax, or days when pain or loss of appetite make life very difficult.Claw-shaped woodland green sepals, arranged in closed stacked calyxes, striped with shocks of indochine brown pistils, and average coverage with thin, short-stalked bent trichomes with average headsVery nice and super sweet Bubblegum smell, one of the most uncanny gum smells around. It turned a bit more fruity when ground and lost the saccharine sweetness.Though it had traces of that strong sweetness and the actual gum flavor, this one tasted mostly like a bit of a ""fruit punch"", with a blend of fruity and sweet flavors and a flowery finish. The smoke was extremely thick and dense (like the nug) but also had a bit of unwanted harshness that burned the throat.This Double Gum was an Indica-dominant experience for sure, with a heavy feeling behind the eyes and a hanging warmth over the body. Sitting gape-mouthed staring at something was not an uncommon effect, and the heavy almost wobbly head made sitting way more satisfying than moving around. It was functional enough but it was much nicer to sit on the couch and just enjoy it. Appetite stimulation was evident, and this was basically a typical Indica effects package thould be nice for an evening session."
Durban Poison,"A landrace sativa variety from South Africa, Durban Poison is known for its spicy/sweet anise-like smell and taste and it's clear-headed cerebral effect.  Though it's a (normally) pure sativa, most versions finish fairly quickly and don't stretch like crazy.  Many claim the real South African Durban Poison is very racy and finishes as long as 120 days, but that's not the case for the versions available in seed form (Afropips and African Seeds seems to be the longest to finish).Landrace South African variety, at times crossed with Skunk for stabilitySam the Skunkman, speaking on the version he is responsible for:South African Durban Poison was first introduced by me.  I got maybe 100 seeds from South Africa and grew them in California in the late 70s.  Most were hermaphrodite, small calyxs, as well as not so great buds.  But I saw the potential for an early sativa so I worked with it for a few years to clean it up.  I finally eliminated most of all the bad traits, and introduced it in the early 80s.When I took it to Amsterdam it was an immediate hit, one of the few sativa strains that can be grown outdoors in Holland most years if the weather is okay at harvest time.  Every seed merchant in Holland bought some and made copies as well as hybrids; all of the Durban Poison genetics being passed around were originally from my work until Afro-Seeds popped up a few years ago.  My Durban Poison is sativa, pure IBL Landrace created from seed lines, maintained with clones, male and female.  There is no change in the genepool now as any seeds are produced from selected clones 20 years old.  The plants had a strong licorice/anise smell and taste, as well as being quite early in maturation.  The strength was med-strong, vigor strong, yield quite good, very consistant.  To be honest I considered it a daytime smoke.Durban is known for possessing a very distinct blend of sweet and spicy smells — fennel/anise, orange, lemon, and a creamy sweetness are the most common descriptors.Very sweet and intoxicatingly complex, Durban Poison presents the sativa-lover with a palate of flavors ranging from sweet lemon candy to spicy anise, making it a favorite of many dispensary patients as well as connoisseurs.Durban is a fabulous daytime strain, with a clear, functional effects package that stimulates creativity, sociability, and overall mood.  It's very energetic and is seen as one of the more pure-feeling sativa varieties widely available on the market. The true South African Durbans are known for being extremely racy and borderline psychedelic, but the toned-down Dutch versions that circulate the United States and Europe lose some of that edge, perhaps for the benefit of the average consumer.  The primary medicinal benefits are energy, appetite stimulation, migraine relief, and anti-nausea properties. Durban was known and loved in Holland because it was one of the few sativas that could finish outdoors — the short-flowering versions are suitable for Northern climates.  Grows very tall outdoors, but most varieties are totally manageable indoors, especially with training such as SCROG.South AfricaMany versions available in seed form — African Seeds, Dutch Passion, Afropips, Nirvana, and Sensi Seeds all have versions of it.Depends on the version, most floating around or from Dutch companies are between 8 and 10 weeks, while the African seed companies tend to be longer, going as long as 120 days."
Dutch Treat Haze,"One of Colorado's underground favorites before becoming a staple at Boulder MMC in Boulder, CO, Dutch Treat Haze is one of the most wonderful Haze hybrids around, bringing the absolute best parts of Green House Seeds' famous Super Silver Haze but moderating the Sativa effect with the uplifting yet still Indica-dominant Amsterdam strain Dutch Treat.  Both parent strains have a citrus element to them, and that comes out in this hybrid, but it also has interesting funky notes of eucalyptus, sandalwood, and floor cleaner.Dutch Treat x Super Silver HazePrior to the establishment of HB 1284 which changed the dispensary scene in Colorado significantly in terms of supply chain, this strain was everywhere and in high demand because the creator was able to sell it to any dispensary who wanted it.  Once the legislation changed and centers had to grow at least 70% of their own cannabis, the creator ended up with Boulder Medical Marijuana Center and the strain has been an in-house favorite ever since, only occasionally being sold elsewhere.The Super Silver Haze used in this cross is from old Dutch stock, as is the Dutch Treat.  This strain shows what new breeding projects can do to reinvigorate what many consider as staid genetic lines, creating very exciting new hybrids.Very light, almost minty green calyxes encase thin pink-red pistils and the nug shape overall is pointed, especially on the non-cola buds, which pop up in perfect little triangles on the stem almost at random.  The trichome coverage and structure is what we'd consider almost perfect, with moderate-sized heads of perfect rounded shape capping medium stems that cover the plant surface in a very even fashion.  The deep sparkle that the dried nugs possess make this an incredible ""bag appeal"" variety for a Sativa-lover.The complex but undeniably Sativa aroma the Dutch Treat Haze offers blends the punchy, reedy side of the Haze family with the sweet, crisp citrus side (which is given an added boost by the sweet and also-citrusy Dutch Treat).  The perfect melding of Haze aromas in the flowers themselves also results in a wonderful floral-fresh-sweet-smelling smoke when it's combusted — in all, a treat for the nose.Much like the smell, the flavor combines the sweet-citrusy Haze and Dutch Treat with the eucalyptus-funky Haze elements that often come out of good old-stock Super Silver Haze.  The flavor is especially noticeable and enjoyable in a joint, where the crisp flavor hangs on the lips all the way through to the crutch and lingers in the mouth and sinuses after smoking.A near-immediate influx of pressure to the eyes and face area signal the arrival of this potent and torquey Sativa.  The internal buzzing and energetic-feeling waves that rush over the body can trend towards the racy and anxious side of things, but patients who don't struggle with nerve excitement or heart-based anxiety issues shouldn't have any issues.  Through the beating heart, the internal motivation fills the mind with racing thoughts and makes socializing at times difficult simply because the mind is so busy — however, experienced users and lovers of true Sativas will enjoy this more than see it as a possible detriment.  The final hour or so of the experience takes a decidedly Indica turn, partly from the ""crash"" that so often comes with powerful Sativas, but partly with the onset of the relaxing Dutch Treat presence.  This one is a great choice for appetite, mood elevation, and energy.BMMC runs the DTH in both very large DWC setups as well as peat-based soil setups and has great success, so the plant can do well in any medium.  It seems to retain its natural flavor better than many strains when grown in hydro, so that may be the best choice for those looking for maximum trichome coverage, ""bag appeal"", yield, and flavor.  The plant itself grows tall and fairly branchy, making it suitable for SCROG moreso than SOG applications — training and a good veg period will reap major rewards yield-wise.Colorado, U.S.A.Clone-only, bred by the master grower at Boulder Medical Marijuana Center (BMMC)75-80 days"
Dynamite,"A surprising favorite amongst the staff, this potent medicinal Indica has a place with any patient who struggles with pain or appetite especially, but it's also a great choice for anyone later in the day or when being physically active isn't required. Watch the dosage with this one though, as it can put you to sleep if you're not careful! Altogether, it's a superb medical strain with a pleasing citrusy taste/smell package.Bred by Next Generation Seed Company as a seed line of popular BC Grapefruit cloneVery nice dense stocky structure with an outwardly frosty pale green sheen.

East Coast Alien,"East Coast Alien in comprised of East Coast Sour Diesel and Alien Technology. East Coast Sour Diesel, also known as NYC Diesel -- The lore around Sour Diesel is immense-- is a vigorous sativa. Meanwhile, Alien Technology is an Afghan landrace indica. A balanced hybrid with growth traits of both an Old World Kush and Sour Diesel, a vigorous sativa in vegitative and flower stages of its growth. Finished buds are dense but with some fingers, as a result of the heavy diesel ancestry. Light green calyxes are encased in purple old world kush style leaves. Fuel and earth tones, rather complex.

Elevation,"The mood elevation was instant and lasting, but the potency was never all that high, and leveled off to a very mild state after about 1.5 hours, which is shorter than we'd like. However, the total duration including lingering eye effects was in the 3 hours area, so patients who medicate for ocular relief might find it more useful than others.Bred in-house by Tree of Life Alternative Medicine in ColoradoA long, slender sample, this strain showed its Sativa dominance in its structure and average density. It was a pale green for the most part, but there were some extremely dark almost blue leaves visible.his sample was a very subdued smell that consisted of fresh vegetation, pine, and a slight sweetness. We mostly got standard smoke notes (often called ""hashy"") along with more of the pine and slight sweetness that were present in the smell.They could call this strain ""mood elevation"" — it really makes you smile to begin with and gives the urge to laugh at almost anything. Starting strong in the eyes and continuing that throughout the experience, this strain feels alternately light and heavy, fluctuating between a floaty head and a heavy body. Despite the sometimes heavy feeling, tasks (both mental and physical) were never an issue, making this a solid choice for retaining productivity while medicated. As it went on, it reduced itself down to a calm body and retained the mood elevation, making for a long lingering finish and a soft drop back to normalcy.ColoradoClone"
F*cking Incredible,"While we are not really fans of the smell and taste of this strain, the effects were enjoyed thoroughly by the staff. This strain provided a solid combination of mood uplift and strong body relaxation while keeping functionality mostly intact — this is a somewhat rare combination of effects that were perfect for fighting off the urge to get up when doing solitary work. The strange purple cast the trichomes had over the entire surface of the bud was also rather unique, especially when viewed with our microscope. If you're a patient that is looking for muscle and pain relief but don't want to be zombiefied and overtly sleepy, this is a very good choice.Bred by Vancouver Island Seed CompanyIf you're a patient who likes big, blocky, dense structure this is the strain for you. Clearly Indica in structure, this strain has a large, conical bud shape with a collection of dark coloration, including an odd lavender cast to most of the trichomes (a few purple heads were spotted, but it was mostly the stems).The smell of this one was typical hashy Indica with just a hint of sweetness that seemed to disappear as fast as it came. A hint of ""garlic bud"" type aroma stuck out at one reviewer as well — our opinion is that this is clearly an Afghani lineage plant based on the smell.Much like the smell, this was a very generic and boring taste for us, simply tasting like hashy smoke for most of the duration. One reviewer did pick up hints of pine and a slight cherry-like sweetness, but it was fleeting. The flavor took a downturn mid-way through the session, bringing a bad, slightly bitter aftertaste to the party that we didn't enjoy at all. The final flush appeared near-perfect though, as the ash was a fluffy white… not sure where the iffy aftertaste came from.This was a fairly unique med in that it felt strongly body-centric and Indica-heavy but seemed to leave the head nearly unaffected and functional. It started almost immediately, with a warming and relaxing body sensation creeping up from the legs through the torso and an overall relaxed mental state taking over. A heavy-headed feeling also came with the territory early on, definitely making us more comfortable on the couch than standing. Logical and social processes seemed uninhibited entirely by this strain, making it good for solitary, sedentary work — it relaxes the body enough to allow the mind to concentrate on the task at hand. If consumed later at night, the relaxation this strain provides will probably lead to sleep.Seed6-8 Weeks"

Firewalker OG,"The pleasant and light OG Kush flavor and smell reminded us of the less aggressive branch of that family (Ghost and SFV), while the super-smooth smoking experience was enjoyed by all of the staff, even those who primarily vaporize.  Very potent and medicinal at first, it evolved into a more base relaxation experience after 1.5 hours or so, which led nicely into sleep when consumed at a late hour.  This is a very solid Kush experience… it both mentally clear and relaxing, while also possessing a stereotypical Kush flavor profile — suitable for either daytime or night time use, it provided solid relaxation without causing sluggishness.Spearhead shaped sycamore green calyxes with dark kelp green accents, formed in tight nodal clusters, with dark copper pistils, and above average density of very short, thick-stalked trichomes with large headsThis sample had a light and spicy Kush scent, carrying a pronounced perfumey, floral hint along with the more standard Kush aromas.  When ground, it got slightly more aggressive and took on a light fuel/chem sharpness that added to the complexity.  This isn't the most pungent sample in the world, but you can smell it sitting in the jar from a good distance… it seems to settle a bit and dissipate quickly once ground though.Very much like the smell, this was a spicy and soil-heavy OG, with a pleasant and non-aggressive Kush flavor.  The smoke was extremely smooth and not expansive, which made it a highly pleasurable smoking experience, especially for those with respiratory issues or patients who are used to vaporizing. This strain made us slightly light-headed and made our hearts race to start, serving to wake up the senses a bit and provide some internal energy that sustained at a high level through the first half of the effects.  A strong pulsing throughout the body (especially the legs and feet) along with moderate amounts of eye and temple pressure signaled the rather high potency of the early effects.  As it progressed, the talkative and social mood changed to a much more sedate one, where internal concentration on one thing at a time was high but sociability and multi-tasking ability was low.  As it left, we felt a little bit drained, but the body effects seemed to keep up at a relatively high level until the end.CaliforniaClone"
Flople,"One reviewer loved this strain and forgave its lack of blinding potency, but the other reviewers felt that it just wasn't potent enough to warrant an A-level grade. Visual appeal for this one was very high, with an array of beautiful colors and tons of sparkling trichomes that were harvested at the proper time. The smell and taste package were perfect for the strain lineage, and they seemed to match for the most part, which is always appreciated. The clean, heady, and energetic effects were perfect for any daytime use, and there were no physical signs of being medicated… good strain for professional situations. It just wasn't potent enough to get into the upper echelon, but it would be great for times when being strongly medicated isn't desired… this is definitely a great beginner smoke.Bred by Karmaceuticals in Denver, ColoradoWith no real flaws visible, a great array of coloration, and a thick layer of trichomes, this was a very stunning sample for our staff. The mix of dark green (almost black), lime green, orange/red pistils, and vibrant royal purple in spots made this a very interesting sample to look at.This sample was a perfect marriage of the two parent strain smell-wise, with the floral and slightly sweet incense notes of the Purple Kush blending with the more herby and spicy Flo's fennel-kissed sweet hash aroma. This was among the cleanest-smelling strains we've had, absolutely floral and something we could smell all day, even though it wasn't all that pungent until it was broken into.Almost matching the smell note-for-note, the taste was again a very clean and floral combination of the two parent strains. A little bit of the typical Purple ""grape incense"" type of flavor crept in, but it was balanced by the distinctive taste of Flo. While it wasn't the most pungent-tasting sample around, the taste stayed at a high level until the end, never getting that ""cashed"" taste or displaying any real harshness. This was a smooth and easy smoke, highly recommended for those who can't deal with aggressive strains that make you cough.This was a light potency strain overall, perfect for a little relaxation while keeping all mental activities running at a high level. Starting off with a delayed effect, it smoothly built to a light, buzzy body feeling that had us motivated and on our feet for most of the review. There was a little bit of head/eye pressure cycling, but overall it was rather clear-headed, with only a bit of euphoria and the desire to shirk responsibilities breaking up the motivated state. As it went along, the body relaxation became more apparent but was still not that direct — as if the mental relaxation moved downwards.ColoradoClone"

G-13 Widow,"This was a superb Indica-dominant cross, bottom line. The overall grow quality and bag appeal was impressive, while the perfect harvest timing seemed like the veritable cherry on top. The two parent strains really aren't known for their taste and smell (both are generally chosen for their potency), but this cross was still very pleasant to smoke, possessing a nice lemony bite. We recommend this most highly as an after work or late-night med, as it puts the user in a very sedative and relaxed state where even basic communication can at times be too much to deal with. Sinking into the couch and enjoying the mood elevation and warm body presence is probably the most likely effect of this med; a real Indica experience despite the slightly rushy start. Great job by the Biocare crew — it was a very well cared-for sample overall that lasted longer than most and retained medicinal potency well into hour #2.Bred by Mr. Nice SeedbankThis was one of the frostiest samples we've gotten in some time, with a thick coating of trichomes covering nearly every surface. The structure of this sample was also very good, with a moderate density and a hearty stickiness.Though it's not an aroma that really marks itself as distinct or uniquely enjoyable, this G-13 Widow produced a lovely sharp lemon-pine scent with a bit of muskiness and also sweetness in the mix. Lemon is at the forefront though for sure, and it was nicely pungent once broken apart.It was mostly a fresh and clean-tasting vegetation with a pine element to it — not really something we'd seek out, but certainly not a bad flavor. The smoke was smooth despite being rather thick, and the final ash was a very light gray, indicating that it had a proper flush.To start, this strain had us feeling slightly racy, with an elevated heart beat, a boost of energy, and the urge to be social and active. A lot of head and eye pressure fluctuations, a buzzing warm body, and a slightly slow/hazy mental state were the other initial pieces of this surprisingly Sativa-oriented start. It was at this point where we had a bit of disagreement on the overall tone of the experience — one reviewer continued on the energetic and clear-headed path while the other two were knocked for a relaxing Indica loop. It seems the time of day and situation might play a larger role in the effects of this med than some others — the energetic one was a mid-day review when the reviewer had things to do, and he functioned well. The others were in the morning and later at night when both reviewers were not busy, so the heavy effects seemed to come through harder. In any case, there was strong body relaxation, mental relaxation, and a persistent ocular/forehead effect that continued well into the 2nd hour. The end of the experience was rather sedative and could easily lead into sleep.NetherlandsSeed56-63 Days"
Ghost Moonshine,"This cross was originally made by Scott of Rare Dankness Seeds when he was operating Stone Mountain Wellness in Longmont, CO.This particular phenotype selection from seed stock leans heavily towards the Ghost's OG side of the spectrum.  Blue Moonshine adds an interesting musky sweetness to the zesty ginger-lemon OG flavor of the Ghost, and serves to thicken up the smoke as well as increase the heaviness of the effects. A light and floaty feeling throughout the head and body starts things off, feeling very Ghost-influenced at first, but some body heaviness creeps in later in the duration and grounds the experience a bit.  Ghost Moonshine is a very relaxing strain but is still somewhat ""up"" mentally, keeping the mood of the user elevated though steady.

Ghost Train Haze #1,"Regardless of expectations going in, this strain had very high marks in all areas, with the smell and appearance especially drawing our attention. We definitely think that this is daytime medicine, as the mental and physical stimulation it gave would likely keep a patient awake at night with mind racing. We actually liked a lower dosage of this strain in terms of daily use, as the psychedelic elements we experienced at high dosages made it less functional both mentally and socially — but those adventurous 'psychonaut' types among the MMJ patient population will likely enjoy those elements of the experience.Bred by Rare Dankness as part of their Ghost Train Haze series pairing legendy OG Kushes with their Nevil's Wreck (Arcata Trainwreck x Neville's Haze) male, this strain redefined maximum potency when High Times tested it at the Cannabis Cup, being named the Strongest Strain on Earth.Wide claw-shaped dark olive green sepals arranged in open cluster calyxes, with bursts of red bronze pisitls, and supreme coverage by long, thin-stalked wavy trichomes with average headsUniversally loved by our staff, the aroma didn't have any real hints of the Ghost's OG side of the lineage, but that didn't seem to matter at all. The scent is a wonderfully sweet yet fresh scent that has hints of anise, grenadine, and citrus mixed together into what several reviewers described as ""cherry-limeade"" or a similar sweet-tangy-tart combination. It's very complex and engaging, and also has just enough of a bite post-grind to remind you of the OG and Haze lineage. Top-notch aroma here, one that Trainwreck and Haze lovers especially will enjoy.After the world-class aroma experience, it's hard not to be slightly disappointed with the flavor, but this one held up very well. The flavor was a little more OG-tinged than the smell was, giving hints of the pine cleaner type of sharpness combined with a hint of the floral Haze sweetness. One this we really enjoyed about this strain was its extremely smooth smoking experience, which never really gave us the urge to cough and retained flavor to about the midway point of the bowl. We had some slight disagreements on the overall potency of this hybrid among the review staff — some staff felt that it was in the top 10% of medicine potency-wise, while others (one of whom who has had the strain previously) thought that it just didn't get to that upper level. That said, the uplifting and energizing effects that kick off this experience will make any real Sativa-lover happy, but might border on anxious for those who struggle with the more energizing strains. A strong 'facial mask' feeling of buzzing pressure kept up at a high level, and our eyes tended to be rather red during the early parts of the duration especially… not a 'stealth' med really. Multiple reviewers reported quite a lot of borderline psychedelic activity, including slight auditory and visual hallucinations and at times felt a bit of sensory overload. At lower dosages than our standard KR review portion, the effect was more manageable and sociable, but otherwise it was a bit too challenging mentally to stay engaged with anything other than one's own thoughts for the most part. The main effects began their decline at about 1.5 hours, but the energy and mental activity kept up through almost the end, when a little bit of a Sativa crash crept in and we felt a little stunted mentally and in a somewhat dreamlike mental state to finish.Seed70-84 Days"

Girl Scout Cookies,"Rumored to be OG Kush x F1(undisclosed strain by original breeders) x Durban Poison. Girl Scout Cookies is one of the most sought-after strains on the market and as a result, is often a favorite choice for growing at home in states where cultivation is legal. Choosing the right cannabis seeds is important when cultivating Girl Scout Cookies. Growers who want effective results time after time look for feminized Girl Scout Cookies seeds to ensure that all plants are female and their harvest will be somewhat predictableUnknown in Truth; popularly claimed to be OG Kush x Durban Poison, or OG Kush x Cherry Pie (GDP x Durban Poison)Very little is known about the origin of Girl Scout Cookies. The only certainty is it was bred in San Francisco, California, sometime in the last couple of years; perhaps 2011 or 2012.The strain was developed by a Nor-Cal group of associates known simply as the Cookie Family. From there, different phenotypes (some perhaps bag-seeds) have been distributed throughout the United States. Most notable of this array of Girl Scout Cookies is the ""Forum Cut,"" made available through internet networking among breeders.Girl Scout Cookies has a tall, branchy, OG-like structure, leaning towards the appearance of a true kush. It has dark leaves that turn black with a complete cold-water flush and have extremely long, thick, wine-red petioles, or leaf stems, that are actually longer than the leaf is in length.To its name, Girl Scout Cookies has a sweet and spicy, oven-baked smell.From the two disclosed parents, Durban Poison and OG Kush, there are taste elements of skunky peppermint and the slightest lemon zest. The ""F1"" unknown parent may be responsible for the yeasty bread-like taste that dominates the pallet.Northern California, circa 2011-2012The original is very hard to acquire as the Cookie Fam strictly limits its availability. The ""forum cut"" is also only available as a clone and many believe it to be the original, though the Cookie Fam disputes that claim. Many seed companies have also developed similar strains by the same name."

Takes after the Hawaiian sativa side of the family structure-wise, growing tall and consuming a lot of root space in ideal conditions.  It's a branchy plant that grows best untopped, but liked judicious pruning of lower lateral stems to encourage top growth.  The wispy structure fills out late in harvest, taking on a golden appearance as it gets closer to finish.Kansas, USAClone only67-77 days, the earlier harvest tends to product the best flavor while a later harvest improves yield and overall potency."
Good Medicine,"Good Medicine was bred by Bodhi Seeds in California and is a Harlequin female, Appalachian male cross. Bodhi developed such knockout high-THC strains like Prayer Tower, Buddha's Hand and Tigers Milk.The dried buds are often spear-like and conical in nature.  A lime green to dark green color scale with bright orange pistils is very common.The ripened flowers smell fruity with musky, earthy after tones.While many CBD crosses end up tasting like hay or hemp, the Appalachian lends enough flavor to qualify this is an enjoyable smoke, especially in oil form where it can lean towards the sweet side of the scale.At 1:1 CBD to THC, and testing around 15% THC, Good Medicine is a great selection for a subdued and relaxing experience. The extended use of this strain, espeically from smoking, increases the amount of CBN consumed. CBN has been demonstrated to be a great sleep aid.

Burnt flowers produce a very strong skunk perfume that is thick in the air and sure to entice others nearby to ask what you are smoking on.Bred specifically for maximum THC, the flavor of Gorilla Glue can be a bit muted and indistinguishable from other strains. This isn't to say that it tastes bad, but it certainly doesn't have the diversified pallet many other strains have.Gorilla Glue was specifically bred for its THC content. Therefore, it isn't the best sleep aid but the racing effect some experience will ease into a general stoniness after an initial rush.The effect is typical of most OG varietals with an early onset of a euphoric rush and a gentle relaxation easing in thereafter for up to several hours. Gorilla Glue is sure to touch on several symptoms including pain management and is sure to trigger apatite stimulation.CaliforniaClone Only.

But if you can manage not to fall asleep, you'll experience a pleasant body warmth and pain relief along with a relaxed and lazy mind-state that will see the hours fly by. Not suggested for daytime use except for patients that don't have much to do, this would make a superb nighttime smoke for those who struggle with sleep and pain issues in the evenings.Afghani LandraceA clone only indica strain that landed in the Pacific Northwest in the 1980s before being taken into seed form by Nevil Schoenmaker's Seed Bank in 1987.Indica-dominance was clear here, with dark greens in leaves and calyxes as well as deep blood red pistils. Generous trichome coverage combined with above average density gave this a classic look.Surprisingly fruity and sweet-smelling when ground up, but also carried some of the signature earthy/hashy/piney smells that the lineage is known for. It's a blend of earthy and hashy flavors that hits heavy despite being rather smooth on the throat.This Hashplant was a bit of a creeper, reaching its full effects approximately 20 minutes after ingestion. The heavy and warm-feeling body and the corresponding feeling in the eyes set the tone for this strain's Indica-dominant effects. A distinct lack of motivation, some spaciness, and the urge to sit around were the main mental feelings this strain caused along with a bit of run-of-the-mill tiredness. However, it did a good job with body effects, delivering a narcotic-feeling experience that left the body very loose, relaxed, and pain-free.

Headband,"One of the most visually-striking samples we've received, with quite the potency punch, as it knocked our review staff for a bit of a loop with its trippy effects full of hallucinations and a head-spinning initial attack. Once it calmed down a bit though it provided great mood elevation, relaxation, and mild pain relief. We'd warn beginners against this strain, as even a small 0.1g dosage was more than enough to put an experienced patient in another mental dimension for a solid 2.5 hours. If you want a bit of a rollercoaster ride and enjoy the taste of a Sour Diesel or Kush, you owe yourself to try this superb example of Headband, as it was by consensus the best example of it that we've ever tried.Chemdog (Chem 91) x (Massachussets Super Skunk x Northern Lights)Originally named Diesel #1 when made on the East Coast by a breeder known as Weasel, it was nicknamed Underdog, and Daywrecker Diesel, before making its way to California to be renamed Headband by a breeder called Loompa.The Northern Lights used in the father was from original Sensi Seeds stock.Stacked tight emerald green spearhead calyxes with occasional eggplant accented water leaves, brick red pistils, medium-length thick-stemmed trichomes with large headsThis is definitely a Diesel-tinged bouquet, especially before being ground up — it was very pungent in the jar, almost more than it was when handled. The mix of fuel, skunk, spice, bitter citrus, and rubber retains its pungency until it settles a bit, when the aroma changes to more of a soft, slightly sweet presence.Much like the smell, but with more of a skunky, rubbery, fuel empahsis to it, and notes of citrus-pine sharpness, with a thick, expansive smoke.The ""phantom sweatband"" feeling was in full effect with this sample, as all reviewers reported a near-immediate rush of blood to the head and that familiar constrictive feeling around the perimeter. Almost dizzying to start, this sample was truly potent and took even our experienced reviewers a bit by surprise.Another interesting similarity was the shared experience of auditory hallucinations, with one reviewer reporting body vibrations coming from sounds and music far more than normal. The high was concentrated in the head, face, and eyes, with some visual hallucinations and an increase in ""eye floaters.""

Hell's OG is now one of the most prolific OG strains on the market. A potent Indica Hybrid, Hell's OG is one of the original variatals of OG Kush. Disputed by many, the history of OG Kush and its many variances is lush and an exciting adventure to investigate. Hell's OG entered the public sphere in the early 1990's. Prior to that, it is rumored that OG Kush was a family heirloom that went back decades in the Lake Tahoe region of Northern California.Hell's OG develops interspaced and spiraled flower nodes, creating small colas. Swollen, dense calyxes result in a chunky look. Small buds are common and completely natural for this strain. Hell's OG smells boldly of pine and musk.OG strains are known for their enveloping, alarmingly putrid stenches.

Hindu Kush,"This strain shined most in its effects, which is really what's most important — the most unique part about it was how quickly and directly the body relaxation was noticed. We also appreciated how the initial mental potency faded away and left behind all the good body relaxation we desired, converting what was a little heavy at first into an effect that felt very clear-headed and functional. We like this Hindu Kush as a daytime type of Indica that will help ease the aches and pains of a day both physically and mentally, while not being overbearing at all and retaining function.Stabilized landrace genetics from the Hindu Kush mountains of Afghanistan and PakistanBroad spade-shaped asparagus green sepals arranged in closed stacked calyxes, streaked with shocks of rust pistils, and well above average coverage by average-stemmed hooked trichomes with large heads, along with small lithocists and peltate trichomesThe aroma in the bag was an understated combination of lightly fruity, musky, and earthy smells that blended together into an almost indecipherable mix. Once it was ground up, it took on a strong earthy element that reminded us of expensive soil — behind that lurked a slightly acrid and musky smell with a tinge of lemons. This one was a bit confusing to us, but enjoyable and pungent enough to please the staff.While one reviewer (using an Incredibowl) experienced no real issues when smoking, two other reviewers disliked the flavor simply because the quality of the smoke seemed to burn the throat slightly and cause immediate coughing. The flavor itself was unremarkable regardless, and was mostly earthy/musky with a hint of sweetness present.Eye pressure and a near-immediate body relaxation were the first effects of this Hindu Kush. The fast-acting body relief was surprising, as the relaxation parts of most strains come on beyond the initial effects, once the buzzing or waving feelings have subsided. This one has us pulled down into the couch in no time, improving our mood, but keeping things relatively sedate and calm nonetheless. The potency lasted at its near-peak level through an hour, having us feeling a little bit slow mentally, but cleared up after that point. Fortunately, the body relaxation lasted longer than the mental effects, which made this a clear-headed relaxer for most of its duration.India/Pakistan45-50Seed45-50 Days"

Indie Kush,"I was a bit surprised by this strain because though I found this sample to be visually appealing, it did not have such a fierce look to it overall, it was just pretty. I judged by the cover once again and once again I was wrong, this is not a beginner strain, and with its short delay I would recommend being patient to let the med do its work before trying to force an effect by increasing dosage.

One of the first reported effects was a butterfly/stomach feeling which was somewhat unusual for our team. Over the next 20 minutes this strain produced a strong rising effect leading to high level spacyness and distortion of equilibrium. A fun exciting ride was the dominant description, but we also found a lack of presentable functionality, temporary introversion, and avoiding human contact. Relief came for all after about the forty five minute mark and most were able to get back to the comfortable state the first ten minutes had offered.ColoradoClone"
Ingrid,"With its distinctive and pungent aroma, it's exceptional trichome coverage, and long-lasting and medicinal effects, Ingrid is truly a winner of a strain. This one would do the trick for almost any type of pain or discomfort, and its relaxing effects were both mentally and physically medicating. It would probably get on top of most patients who aren't heavy users, as even a 0.3g dose was enough to put a veteran into the ""overwhelming"" range at the onset. Its enduring medicinal-level efficacy was the key component of its high score, as there was almost no drop-off in effects as the 2nd hour elapsed, which is unusual.Swiss Big Bud IBLIngrid was a strain developed from 2000-2007 from a Swiss variety of Big Bud commonly used for hash production, originally appearing in the San Francisco Bay area A uniform medium green with huge tall trichomes and pale orange hairs. It had some of the best trich coverage in terms of density and trich head size that we've seen; seems like a true Hashplant. Nicely swelled and bubbly calyxesVery strange, uncanny, and pungent odor that smells like sweet citrus dog poop. Especially pre-grind, that is all you can think of — it's a weird putrid sweetness with a sharp attack. After it's grind, it got even stronger with a component of herbiness but mostly an acrid musk and the sweet citrus poo smell. Fortunately it didn't taste like it smelled, and instead produced an ethereal and herby taste with notes of sandalwood with notes of sandalwood that almost reminded us of a Haze. Another interesting trait is the wonderful almost menthol-citrus sweet smell the actual smoke had, as it left the room smelling fragrant. The taste wasn't overt at any point, but the smoke was very pleasing and smooth with no coughing.Right off the bat, this strain produced a strong experience, with low eyes and a rising warmth that entered the head, face, and eyes (especially the eyes, which were almost burning). It was nearly dizzying, making it a little bit difficult to walk around without getting a little unbalanced or having to take it a little slower than normal. Once the initial attack subsided (about 30-45 minutes), a glorious and medicating body high was the main effect. Superb relaxation throughout the entire body with a good deal of warmth and the urge to stretch and yawn makes this one perfect for relaxing after a day of physical activity. It stayed at medicinal levels well into the 2nd hour and is one of the better body-centric strains we've had recently.SwitzerlandClone"

Which is capable of competing with the best strains out there.Bred on Vancouver Island by legendary Canadian breeder, Breeder Steve.  Reportedly, Steve initially thought the parentage was Grapefruit x Big Skunk Korean, but after flowering the seeds, determined that he had mislabeled the male and that it was his Northern Lights/Haze.A light green with pale orange pistils, dense, stout flowers prone to foxtaililng if harvested late.  Mid-long stemmed small-headed trichomes.A truly delicious-smelling sample, it broadcasts an actual skunky smell that has a bit of sweetness while in the jar. When broken up, it blows up into a wonderful combination of sweet citrus, soil, and pine that is truly pungent. A top-notch example of both facets of this strain's signature aroma.Like a piña colada stirred with a pine branch, it was a combination of velvety citrus with a pine twang.After a short delay, the effects came on strongly — moments of staring off at nothing or deeply thinking about random subjects mingle into what amounts to a rather spacey experience to start. This strain was unique in that it kept up its potency for quite a long time, only dialing down slightly from its heady start as it went on. This I.S.S. became more apparent in the body as the minutes ticked by, relaxing the limbs quite a bit and warding off any aches and pains while maintaining a floaty brand of functionality. With occasional returns of the spaciness, this med provided a relaxing but functional ride that lingered for a really long time, eliminating the desire to re-medicate for nearly 4 hours.British ColumbiaClone12-14 Weeks"
J-1,"This strain had elements of both parent strains evident in nearly all of its qualities, expressing the crisp, citrusy, cool elements of Jack Herer, and the kick of sweetness from Skunk. There were some flaws, but the harvest timing and trichome preservation made up for the hermie-induced tiny seeds that were spotted. This one was a great after-work unwinder type of med, that won't completely knock you to the couch, but trended towards sedentary activities and a singular focus. Its potency was medium-high to start, but declined sharply at about 2 - 2.5 hours, placing it in the intermediate patient area.Spearhead-shaped dingley green sepals, arranged in open cluster calyxes, with bursts of mocha colored pistils, and average coverage with short hooked trichomes with large headsThe aroma mixed the best parts of both parent strains, with a citrus-kissed freshness coming from the Jack Herer and a heavy dose of sweetness from the Skunk. It reminded us of orange candy, and even a hint of gasoline-like sharp sweetness… its pungency wasn't amazing, but it was definitely a strong aroma that gained pungency after being broken apart.Much like the post-grind smell, the flavor was fresh, sweet, and sugary with some citrusy elements. The smoke also seemed to perfume the room, making it smell spicy and pleasant. A very smooth smoke, this one was easy on the throat and did not cause coughing with out staff, even those who have asthma. The final ash was a medium-light gray, showing the flush was sufficient.Coming on quickly, after only a few hits, this one made us feel slightly light-headed (not in a bad way… more 'floaty') but immediately calmed the nerves after a long day and placing us in a placid, peaceful mindset. Despite the inner calm, it did make our hearts race a bit to start, but that effect dissipated relatively quickly, at around 30-45 minutes, when the effects reached their peak. Though we felt a little spacey and couch-oriented randomly throughout the experience, it was calming enough to focus on one thing at a time, without being overtly sedative. We felt this one fell at near 50/50 Sativa/Indica in terms of effects… the second half was definitely on the relaxing side, but it never made us want to go to sleep.CaliforniaClone only"
Jack Flash,"Great stuff! High quality in every category. Its powerful cerebral buzz, mixed with a milder body high, has made this strain an up-and-coming contender for top medical strains. Jack Flash is a great looking strain with many desirable traits. When this strain is around, do not hesitate to try some for yourself.Jack Herer x Super SkunkBred by Sensi Seeds to be a high-yielding easy-to-grow strain with the cerebral high of their Jack HererClaw-shaped palm green sepals arranged in loose clustered open calyxes, with frequent bursts of long fiery orange pistils, and well above average coverage by thin-stemmed wavy trichomes with large heads, along with small lithocists and peltate trichomesLovers of this strain will definitely recognize the smell immediately, with its combination of crisp, almost ""cool"" aromas including lemon, eucalyptus, and cleaner. Though not a super-pungent strain in general, this one was definitely noticed in the bag and increased in pungency when broken apart. Spicy citrus Haze smell gave way to a more smooth and outright sweet orange cream type of aroma after the grind, both of which we loved.While sharing qualities with both the pre and post-grind aroma, the flavor just fell short of those heights, giving more of a lightly sweet and floral, creamy orange flavor on the inhale, and a sharper more haze-like and spicy exhale. The flush seemed well-done, as the final ash was a fluffy light gray and white, and the smoke was very smooth throughout the experience.Starting mainly in the face and jaw area, the effects came on smoothly yet strongly, but never bordered on overwhelming. The immediate mental uplift that this strain brought had us ready to get into a variety of activities, while the relaxing body presence also made sitting very comfortable in stretches. We liked how smooth this strain feels, as it didn't cause any heart-pounding or anxiety. It felt alternately Sativa and Indica, with some reviewers reporting more of an Indica effect later in the day and at higher dosages, while more Sativa effects seemed present at lower dosages and earlier in the day, in general. The effects took a decline at about an hour, but then stayed relatively constant through the end of the duration, seemingly disappearing with no after-effects.NetherlandsSeed"
Jah Kush,"A uniquely funky and long-lasting OG Kush hybridA pungent cash crop strain that was brought into the Northern California clone only scene from Oregon.  THe most probable parentages are Light of Jah x OG Kush and Jack Herer x OG Kush; with it's pungent aroma somewhat reminiscent of Light of Jah, this parentage is strongly suspected.Bright green with burnt orange pistils and dense coverage with long, thin stalked trichomes with mid-sized heads.A strange ""garlic bud"" almost body odor citrus musk with notes of soil. You don't really get a sense of that muskiness until it's ground, at which point it becomes eye-watering pungent.Pungent, earthy citrus bite - almost a skunky kushFeeling a little rushy to start, this strain was a little deceiving — a major rush of warmth and pressure into the eyes and head normally signals the beginning of a Sativa crush, but this one backed off after about 30 minutes and remained relatively calm throughout. Somewhat bleary-feeling eyes remained past the initial potency, but otherwise the effects moved mostly into the body while just providing a sense of calmness and a lazy mood elevation. The lingering effects lasted longer than many strains, but the initial potency was shorter than many… bit of a give and take there.OregonClone only"

Jilly Bean,"With is distinctive sweet-meets-bitter citrus flavor, and great structure, we give this Jilly Bean a hearty endorsement for patients seeking a relaxing yet mentally active experience. Its potent, but not-too-potent effects package was perfect for a relaxing day of sedentary work or unwinding in the evening. Patients who suffer from anxiety issues can find relief here, as this is a Sativa that will not cause panic or discomfort, even at higher dosages. This is a great example of the strain, and the strain itself is a unique and flavorful one — that makes for a wonderful combination.An exceptional example of a seed form with the orange punch flavor of Aeric77's Cali O[range] bred by TGA/Subcool.  The strain has experienced a resurgence in popurity thanks to the sweet citrus terpenes that it yields well in hash oil.Spade-shaped pesto green sepals arranged in loose stacked open calyxes, snaked with shocks of rich gold pistils, and above average coverage by long thin-stemmed wavy trichomes with slightly small headsThe main aroma is a very orange/grapefruit-heavy citrus scent, but the backing spiciness comes out post-grind, releasing an almost garlic-like quality that almost took over the citrus. While it wasn't pungent in the realm of a Sour Diesel or something like that, it was very pungent for its type and even in a closed baggie could be detected from a few feet away, broadcasting its citrusy musk.This one seemed to almost change at times, with some of us reporting a straight up orange drink (yep, like Tang) flavor, complete with the artificial quality of it all, while some got more of the spicy almost fuel-like qualities from the post-grind smell. The early hits tended to be more sweet, but left a bitter citrus oil taste lingering on the lips that hinted at the flavor of the later hits. This is an amazing orange strain though, most people will notice the similarities to the fruit immediately, whether it's the smell or the taste.The effects of this Jilly Bean were felt quickly and strongly, but it never got us to that racy or anxious state that some strong starters do, keeping us feeling mentally at-ease the entire time, though mentally energized. An increase in eye pressure (but not facial pressure) and a fluttery feeling in the chest were the early physical manifestations, but mentally it was definitely uplifting, greatly improving our mood and showing no outward signs of medication, making it a good professional/""stealth"" type of strain. There was some visual enhancement as well, and in general, our senses felt very aware and acute. Despite the energy, most of us found that we spent most of our time sitting and smiling rather than being up and active — this is a relaxing Sativa overall, feeling much like a 50/50 hybrid as the lineage would indicate. During the last hour or so of effects, the Indica side came out more, and we felt very relaxed, with strong muscle relaxation and at times heavy eyes.CaliforniaSeed55-65 Days"

K2 (Colorado),"Very high marks in all ""bag appeal"" areas, this sample simply screams ""connoisseur-grade cannabis"".  The effects were definitely a mixed bag typical of most hybrids, with a Sativa start and a more Indica-feeling finish. It was a bit overwhelming initially and left us feeling a bit self-conscious about our extremely medicated appearance, even in environments that were MMJ-friendly. Otherwise it was a good mid-day type of med for days when the stresses of life an/or daily aches and pains are getting to you — watch the dosage if you're a newer patient though, as it can definitely get on top of you.Named for the second tallest peak in the Himalayas. Not to be confused with the Dutch commercial strain named K2 of an entirely different lineage.A seriously pretty sample, this one has the structure/appearance that many of our staff prefers over all others, which is the well-defined, slightly loose one where you can see each calyx clearly and all the trichomes covering them. The blend of light, frosty green with the jack-o-lantern orange pistils gave it a classic look, but with an the thick covering of trichomes.This one instantly vaulted itself into the upper-echelon of our staff's ""Must Smell"" list — the uber-sweet ""blue candy""-like smell also carried hints of oranges, strawberries and a grazzy/fresh quality one reviewer described as ""spring breeze""… there was a tinge of cleaner in there too, like Formula 409. Pre-grind it was very pungent as well, with the ability to stink up a room when the jar/bag is opened — it was a stronger, sharper smell pre-grind as well, which was unique (it had notes of sweet curry, fall spices, and honey). Top notch smell here, simply put.After the smell being one of the high points of the last month or so (seriously, it smells that good), it was hard for the taste to live up to the billing, and that played out here. The dominant taste was a piney lime that has musky/sharp elements that brought to mind the OG part of the lineage… there was a sweetness present, but it wasn't nearly as sweet as the smell. This med seemed to hit our crew slightly different, with one reporting 75% Sativa effects, one reporting a 50/50 split, and another reporting 75% Indica-dominant feelings. It seems as if being in a different environment controls how the effects play out — reviewers were solitary seemed to have more of an Indica experience while others that were in work/social situations seemed to trend Sativa. Regardless, it started off with strong eye effects (not a stealth med at all), forehead/temple pressure, and ringing in the ears… seemed heavily Sativa at first. The potency was almost too much at times, especially for the work situations — moments of spacing out were common. Once the blast of initial potency moved on, the cloudy vision and eye effects contributed to a feeling of slight tiredness and fairly thorough mental/physical relaxation.ColoradoClone"
Kandy Kush,"OG Kush x Train Wreck (T4)According to the breeder, DNA Genetics, the goal with this cross was to combine the OG flavor with the Train Wreck bud structure. The OG Kush mother brings medical benefits and a tasty, pronounced terpene profile. The Train Wreck father brings high commercial yields, resin production, and lemony scents. The sweetness in the Kandy Kush is courtesy of the OG Kush female and is where the name stems from. This plant is known for its high resin production and is stated to be one of the most resinous in the entire DNA Genetics catalogue. This strain took 1st at the Colorado Cannabis Crown 2010 for best medical cannabis out of 140 strains.Once again, this strain can vary greatly in appearance depending on the specific phenotype. The shape can range from more oblong-shaped like the Train Wreck to more circular-shaped like the OG; however, they are all dense – a characteristic of both parents. Given the sativa influence of the Train Wreck, nearly all phenotypes will have orange pistils but coverage density will vary. Kandy Kush produces a thick coat of resin, thus buds will appear ‘frosty’.While the variances in phenotype will apply to smell as well, Kandy Kush can generally be described as sweet, earthy, and piney. Some cuts will lean towards the OG Kush with distinct scents of sweet Pine Sol and lemons with a slight bite of fuel. Other cuts will lean towards the Train Wreck with scents of pine needles (herbal), flowers, and a slight bite of pepper. Because this strain is available from both seed and clone, there are a variety of phenotypes floating around. Although specific flavor profiles will vary, Kandy Kush generally has a sweet, piney, and pungent taste. The smoke is refreshing and keeps you coming back for more. Those growing from seed will have their choice of a variety of flavor profiles that can lean heavily towards one parent or the other. Those growing from clone should inquire as to the specifics of that particular cut.Depending on the particular mix of indica to sativa, this hybrid strain can be effective as either a daytime or a nighttime smoke. For many users, the sativa influence of the Train Wreck can overpower the heavier effects of the OG Kush. In general, the effects can be described as uplifting, euphoric, relaxing, and mood enhancing. The sativa dominant strains will result in initially increased energy levels and focus. Kandy Kush is great from managing stress, pain, and depression.DNA GeneticsAvailable in both seed and clone form9-10 weeks (63-70 days)"
Katsu Bubba Kush,"OG Kush x West Coast Dawg (Dog) x Old World KushFrom an indica dominant Chem Dog, a California breeder generarted a backcross, West Coast Dog, that was later gifted to Katsu, another breeder. That cut was bred to an old world Kush (South Asian landrace) and again to OG Kush. This is believed to be the original Bubba Kush (which some dispute).A spectacular hybrid, this phenotype of Bubba Kush is exhilarating and motivating in comparison to most hardline indicas. Perhaps due to the detectable presence of OG Kush on the flavor pallet, it is a well balanced strain with both sativa and indica effects. Clustered calyxes like OG Kush with purple spikey water leaves that give the classic ""Bubba"" appeal. A bit more lenghty nodes and less golf-ball shaped than Pre '98 Bubba Kush.

There are two standard phenotypes, one of which that grows an extremely strong central cola and the other which is a little branchier.  Both have dark indica leaves and can take heavy feeding, resist disease/mold, and work well in small quarters.  It's an easy-to-grow plant that is a good choice for beginners in any medium.California, USA via Amsterdam, The NetherlandsDNA Genetics7-8 weeks"

It varies according to phenotype, but generally it's a slightly sweet musk with hints of citrus.  The taste is definitely dominated by the Afghani part of the lineage rather than the Skunk. Starting off with an increase in visual acuity and a strongly spacey mental state, this strain can seem like it's a Sativa early on, living up to the psychedelic namesake.  Once those initial effects passed, it still seems to stay mostly in the face but the body presence grows greatly as it progresses.  A creeping numbness and warmth enters the body, leaving the user able to get up and be active or simply sit and relax.  The end of the experience was more sedate and relaxing, bordering on tired-feeling.  This strain is recommended to intermediate users who want a little more adventure in their Indica relief.

Lavender Haze (Colorado),"This strain fit very well into our daytime routines and pleased us with its distinctly floral elements which were present in both the aroma and flavor. We appreciated the cure and overall texture quite a bit, and it seemed to help the aroma stay present whether it was ground or sitting in the jar. The combination of relaxation and mental uplift this strain offers had us feeling positive but smoothly relaxed for upwards of 3 hours, making this a great strain to medicate with mid-day and feel relief until early evening.

The name really makes sense once a whiff of the scent is detected, as it is ripe with flowery qualities and does bring to mind actual lavender. It's like the Blueberry side of the family took a vacation and left the Haze at home to play, though there is a slight sweetness (some described it as ""purple, but not grapey"") underlying the Haze elements. It's not the most pungent sample around, but it's definitely noticeable in the jar, and becomes nicely pungent once broken apart.The flowery, almost soapy Haze elements from the aroma came through strongly in the flavor, though it wasn't quite as pleasing to our tastes as it was in aroma form for whatever reason. It has a light sweetness to it, but it was mostly present on the initial inhale, changing quickly to the more floral flavor that remained until the aftertaste. The smoke was light and crisp in the mouth, hitting smoothly and not really causing coughing except on some large hits. The final ash was a fluffy medium-light gray, showing it had received a proper flush.This strain is somewhat unique in that it seemed to come on as more of an Indica to start, relaxing us and knocking us down a peg slightly, then transitioning into a more uplifting and Hazy effect after about 30 minutes. We felt that this one put us in a meditative state where we could function and work, but it carried a bit of signature Haze spaciness that had us walking around in circles at times, enjoying some of the psychoactivity it offered. The smooth effects peaked around 45 minutes, then gradually declined from there, lingering out to over 3 hours for most of our staff.ColoradoClone"

The smell doesn't quite translate into the flavor fully, but there are still hints of the perfect mango taste (obscured by the taste of smoke and vegetation slightly). As the lineage would indicate, it's a slightly cerebral-feeling Indica experience that gains an extra mental punch from the Sensi Star in the early parts of the duration — the initial punch can be too much some some people, as it even affected equilibrium a bit.  It becomes relaxing on a base level and increasingly functional as the time went on though, with that initial blast of potency lasting about 45 minutes - 1 hour.  Recommended as a general relaxation med for the most part, some rather strong ocular attention, mild pain relief, and some sleep aid during the comedown.

The warming body sensation was appreciated, as it started almost immediately and also ccontributed to the improved demeanor.

Mentally it was fairly difficult to concentrate on tasks and this one was best left to the couch and evening relaxation.Southern CaliforniaClone-only59-66 Days"
Master OG,"This Master OG is perfect for an early evening relaxation, serving to ease both the mind and body while never feeling pushy or overwhelming. Though we would've liked more peak potency, it still had quite a bit of medicinal value, especially through the first 1.5 hours — but even past that, it left a lingering relaxation that aided sleep a great deal. Its appearance and smell were both above-average, though the smell was somewhat tame for a Kush, lacking some of the acrid notes that many of them have (which is a good thing for many people).Teardrop-shaped sage green calyxes with maroon pistils, and long thin-stalked trichomes with large headsThis OG had a fresh, sweet, perfumey, spicy, slightly fruity aroma that was easily noticed from several feet away but wasn't ever overbearing. After grinding, some sharpness came out and it increased in pungency further, releasing an aroma that had a rubbery sting that you often find in Diesel strains.Much like the smell, the taste was on the light side of the OG spectrum, bringing more of a spicy and barely sweet taste that didn't carry any of the sharpness. It got rather smoky and nutty-tasting after the initial hits, but was never unpleasant. This was a rather smooth-feeling OG experience, coming on easily and slowly over the first 15 minutes. Other than the eyelids lowering and some redness, there were not many physical head effects to start — however, the body felt warm and relaxed despite the heart beating a little faster than normal initially. An elevated but not euphoric mood made us feel calm and productive when consumed in the daytime, very relaxed and ready for bed when consumed late at night. It lost a lot of its power at 1-1.5 hours, but though the overt effects died down, the mental and physical relaxation continued.CalifoniaSeed60-67 Days"

It really shined when put under the camera lens, as it's a beautiful specimen.Heirloom Hawaiian IBLAn heirloom inbred line from Hawaii that has been propagated in seed and stable cutting formFat foxtailed dark green calyxes with sienna pistils, and medium length and medium thickness stalked trichomes with large heads. Foxtailed dark green calyxes with sienna pistils, and medium length and medium thickness stalked trichomes with large headsA bit piney, a bit earthy, but with a unique spicy smell that reminded us of fennel or even holiday spices. It wasn't very pungent until it was ground up.Much like the smell, a pine taste was the dominant note, but there was also some lemon and a slight sweetness. It was expansive yet very smooth on the throat.The back of the head began to feel heavy, but the eyes and forehead filled with pressure and a buzzing sensation, with the eyes in particular being heavily medicated to the point that they almost felt blurry. A very potent start for this strain, it took us to a state where the head effects were nearly overwhelming, sending one reviewer off for a nap.Overall though, it was energetic in an even and non-rushy way, and felt capable mentally after the initial potency retreated. It also lightened the mood quite a bit, making us talkative and positive mentally. Very clean finish, it faded out without notice, lingering in the eyes for quite some time.HawaiiSeed63-70 Days"

Medicine Woman,"Lineage uknown, possibly a CBD-rich hemp phenotypeMedicine Woman is a very vigorous sativa strain. Its origins come from a confidential CBD breeding project of which details are very limited. Because the plant grows and looks like hemp, many speculate that it was a high CBD hemp female that was pollinated with desirable traits to grow indoors.A 20:1 CBD rich strain with excellent medicinal properties. This strain has been demonstrated to reduce seizures in childen with epilepsy, similar to Charlotte's Web. A heavy CBD strain, and usually reserved for concentrates and extracts, Medicine Woman is recommended with those suffering from nerve pain or nerve disorders. CBD has also been demonstrated as an antioxidant and beneficial nutritional supplement. "
Mental Floss #3,"This sample was not overtly potent and felt smoothly enjoyable the entire time, only trending a little towards the drowsy towards the end, which normally works out well for a middle-evening medicating session. Mental Floss has a very unique bag appeal, with its strikingly colorful appearance and floral incense-meets-berry smell having us very excited to try it. The tiny seeds we found in areas were certainly disappointing, but didn't really seem to affect the smoking experience much, nor the look. The effects were perfect for an after-work uplift leading into early bedtime. We'd recommend this med to patients of any experience level, though it isn't quite top-level in terms of overall potency and duration. The unique aural effects this one had might make it particularly interesting to musicians or avid music listeners.Bred by Chimera Seeds to be a large yielding strain with a pleasant aromaSpearhead-shaped sepals in a range of greens from chalet green to dull avocado with eggplant accents, arranged in tight stacked calyxes, with bursts of moccaccino pistils, and above average coverage short thin-stemmed hooked trichomes with average headsThe aroma that this strain expressed was a blend of floral, sweet, and berry smells that mixed into a harmonious whole that we all enjoyed greatly. Once ground, it released a stronger incense-like aroma that seemed to be a magnification of the previous floral elements. Though it was nicely pungent right after being ground up and even in the jar, it dissipated quickly from there. Not an amazingly pungent smell, but it combined smells from the spicy/floral/incense area with the more standard sweet berry in a unique way.The taste was a less distinct and pronounced version of the smell, with the same blend of floral and berry elements, but with a mentholated quality that almost seemed to make it less pungent. However, what flavor was there seemed to last for some time in the session, even as gray ash was beginning to form.Coming on fairly quickly (within 5 minutes), the early effects of this strain felt heavily Sativa for sure, giving us a package of head effects including light pressure which felt like a buzzing ""finger"" poking into the forehead, and a general uplift in mental energy. Along with this came a definite uptick in heart rate and a light-feeling body that felt freed from many of the muscle aches and light pains of the day. Feeling capable and energetic, we found ourselves organizing things or simply enjoying the seemingly heightened sense of hearing, which had us picking up all manner of tiny sounds and processing them all at once. After the initial hour or so, the effects began to become much more relaxing, though the direct muscle relaxing quality that was present at first decreased in strength — the eyes felt dry and tired, increasing the tired feeling. We felt slightly lethargic at times, and overall, we found the comedown and later effects to be a little drowsy and typical of a Sativa ""crash"".CanadaSeed63-70 Days"
Mob Boss,"ChemDawg D x Tang Tang malesOne of the most trichome-laden strains we've ever seen at KindReviews, Mob Boss (especially the Tang Tang-dominant phenotypes) is absolutely covered with trichomes, from fan leaf stems to the tip of the large colas.  This distinctive appearance and very stout density makes its ""bag appeal"" off the charts for most patients, eliciting ""wow""s from all but the most jaded connoisseurs.  When growing, the different phenotypes will be readily-apparent due to their differences in smell, but the Tang Tang-dominant phenotypes will be taller and will have a stronger, pointed central cola while the Chem D phenos will chunk up a bit more but stay shorter with rounded-top colas.An herbal-citrus aroma is the predominant one before the strain is broken apart — the Tang Tang side of the family is not known for its scent. Once broken apart, it displays a hint of the sharpness from the Chem D, but is still largely vegetal and citrusy.  The Chem D-dominant phenotypes will have a much sharper aroma with elements of the notorious chemical-skunk-citrus funk of the mother, but the Tang Tang still tends to tone the whole  package down slightly from the original D.Like the smell, it's not the most pungent thing around, tasting of herbal citrus with hashy notes in the background and a thick, expansive smoke.  Again, the Chem D phenotypes have a more assertive flavor and a lingering aftertaste of chem.Thanks to the Tang Tang influence, this strain isn't nearly as heavy or overtly potent as the ChemDawg D, which is a good thing for many patients who still like to be productive during their day.  The couchy yet cerebral D influence is still felt though, especially in the second half of the experience (most strongly in the Chem-dominant phenotypes).  The Tang Tang phenos tend to be very clear-headed and smoothly uplifting, feeling like a moderate Sativa — the different expressions of this plant definitely deliver different effect packages.  Despite its absolutely ridiculous appearance, Tierra Rojo refers to this strain as a bit of a ""show pony"" in that it doesn't quite live up to the insane potency that the looks promise.  Still, it's above-average in potency and delivers a balanced effect which aids with muscle relaxation, mood elevation, appetite stimulation, and often gives a boost of energy as well (Tang Tang plants especially).The Tang Tang adds vigor and yield to the Chem D and branches well, making this a superb plant for SCROG methods, as it will produce large colas on well-trained side branches and continues growing more dense into the final week.  This plant seems to give the best combination of yield and quality when grown in a coco-based medium and fed heavily — the trichome production displayed from week 3 on is astounding and the Mob Boss tends to look like the ""whitest"" plant in almost any room due to the fan leaves being caked with densely-packed thin-headed trichomes.  The Tang Tang phenos will have more pointed colas while the Chem D will be more rounded and blocky at the tops.California, USAGrindhouse Medical Seeds60 to 70 days depending upon phenotype"

Moonshine Haze,"This hybrid stunned the world when it won the 2011 High Times Cannabis Cup in Amsterdam for the ""Best Seed Company Sativa"" after being entered by first-time competitor Rare Dankness Seeds.  It's a classic fusion of some of the best Hazes the Dutch scene has to offer with just a little bit of Cali genetics (the Trainwreck) to spice up the package.  Its spear-shaped and pointed colas take after the Trainwreck, but otherwise it takes most strongly after the sweet Amnesia Haze, carrying slight elements of the reedy, slightly musky Neville's Haze as well.Soma's Amnesia Haze x Nevil's Wreck (E-32 Trainwreck x Neville's Haze)Scott, master breeder for Rare Dankness Seeds said that this strain resulted from conversations with friends over the years about what a strain must have in order to win a Cannabis Cup.  Amsterdam is known for its love of Haze genetics, but it's also the place where the judges are perhaps most jaded on the holiest of holy strains Amsterdam has to offer. This lead to Scott creating the Moonshine Haze, using the wonderful workhorse Nevil's Wreck male to impart extra potency, trichome coverage, and aroma to the Amnesia Haze.The strain was entered in the sativa category and High Times Senior Cultivation Editor Danny Danko announced it as the Seed Company Sativa 1st place winner, eliciting a ""rebel yell"" from Scott, who was in the audience nearby.  This award finished off what ended up being a sweep for Colorado genetics in Amsterdam for the Seed Company cups.Many of the photos below were from a batch grown personally by Scott of Rare Dankness Seeds and is from the same batch which won the Cannabis Cup in Amsterdam.The nugs tend to be more pointed than rounded, and have a very strong and bold green coloration, with a classic look thanks to the bright orange pistils.  It has large calyxes for its lineage and gets a boost of trichome density from the Trainwreck which makes certain areas of the buds look almost gray at times (especially the underside of leaves).The scent definitely seems to be Amnesia Haze-dominant, with a lightly citrusy, sweet, fresh aroma that is easily-noticed as soon as the jar is opened, though it's more of a ""what's that lovely smell?"" as opposed to ""whew, what stinks?"" situation.  When ground apart, its already strong pungency increases further, bringing out a slight sandalwood/spice haziness which adds complexity to the exceedingly pleasant, floral Amnesia smell.  This strain brings to mind several of the best things about Haze, and lovers of that genetic line will undoubtedly find something to their liking here.Sweet and floral elements are most prevalent on the inhale, but the hint of citrus comes out on the exhale, leaving a lingering Haze note on the palate.  The smoke perfumes the smoke perfumes the room like most good Haze tends to do and is very smooth on the throat and not particularly expansive.Starting off with a near-immediate boost of internal energy and a buzzing sensation throughout the head and body, this sativa definitely feels as such early on.  Mood is elevated, sensory perception seems heightened, and the mind becomes very active, if a little bit jumpy and frantic at times.  It's not a very ""facial"" strain, only providing a little bit of eye and face buzzing early in the duration, residing primarily in the brain instead.  After the stimulating initial effects have subsided a bit (normally around the 1 to 1.5 hour mark), it becomes a wonderfully care-free yet clear-headed sativa which doesn't drop mood or ""crash"" at the end, but rather keeps the user on an even mental keel and fully able to function.  This is a great daytime choice for stimulating the mind and body and generally improving the tone of the day.Scott [at time of original print] primarily grows in a very regimented hydroponic setup, and these plants are no exception.  As they take a long time to flower, it's advisable to flip lighting to 12/12 when they're under 18 unless high ceilings are available.  The plant responds well to SCROG techniques and will form a large footprint rather easily due to the candelabra-like side branching imparted by the Trainwreck.Colorado, USARare Dankness Seeds92 days for the Cup-winning phenotype"

NOFF,"This strain is essentially adding more Indica influence to the Colorado Cough by backcrossing it to the Northern Lights #5 — that lineage could be seen in all parts of the experience we had. We never expected all that much from the flavor and smell of the strain for that reason, and that basically shook out the way we expected, with none of us really finding those elements remarkable. However, we all felt that the effects were superb, especially given that it outlasted most strains in terms of medicinal-level potency and overall duration. This is a perfect strain for a day off at home or an evening after a tiring day of work, serving to deeply relax the mind and body and relieve most pains. It didn't really elevate our mood, but put it us in a contemplative, at-ease state that would be conducive to activities such as yoga or meditation.The Fort Collins Cough mother is a beloved Colorado clone-only strain Northern Lights #5 x Haze #17Claw-shaped forest green sepals, arranged in loose open stacked calyxes, with sparse russet brown pistils, and above average coverage thin-stemmed wavy trichomes with larger than average heads While not a smell that will really impress anyone, this strain smelled much like we would expect, given the lineage. It was lightly citrusy, with a spicy, hashy background that increased in pungency when ground or broken up. It essentially smelled to us like Colorado Cough with less of the Haze qualities.Like the smell, the flavor wasn't overtly pungent or noteworthy in terms of appeal. We got some lightly floral flavors that brought to mind hibiscus tea and some light citrus overtones, but otherwise it was mostly earthy and a bit smoky. One thing that we all liked about this strain is how smooth it was, never really making us cough due to either harshness or expansion — great choice for those who love a smooth smoking experience.This was the area where this strain really shined, after a middling performance in the smell and taste areas. The initial effects of this strain came on strongly, but seemed to increase in potency further over the first 30 minutes or so. A ""facial mask"" pressure feeling, slightly reddened eyes, and what one reviewer referred to as a ""glazing euphoria"" overtook us, immediately taking hold of our mental focus and leaving us a bit detached from the world. The senses seemed open and aware, but the brain was a bit slow at handling the sensory inputs. Body-wise, there was a strong relaxation happening in the neck and shoulder area after the first hour especially, which served to kill off upper back pain and gave us a feeling similar to just coming out of a sauna. the slight mental stupor (it was described positively as a ""meditative state"") combined with the deep body relaxation made the second half of this experience superb for a quiet evening at home rather than out and about. A long, steady dwindle of effect left us ready for sleep by the end.ColoradoClone"

Some lightly sweet lemon blends with oddly spicy juniper The effects of this strain are hard to pin down despite it being rather potent.  It starts out with a racy set of Sativa effects that brings to mind the Trainwreck part of its lineage — a racing heart, some perspiration, and lots of facial ad ocular pressure cycling.  Once that introductory state passed, it was a uniquely visual and cerebral experience, lending itself to solitary creative situations more than social ones.  To finish it often comes with a fairly heavy crash, leaving the user lethargic, heavy-eyed, and ready for bed.

Northern Lights,"A stout, disease and mold-resistant plant with dark green, broad leaves, it seems apparent that Northern Lights is Afghani in origin.  There are several varieties of Northern Lights that worked their way into breeding stock for Sensi Seeds.  Northern Lights #1 is rare these days and was the taller and frostier selection with a fresh scent; Northern Lights #2 is more stout, piney-smelling, and very mite-resistant; Northern Lights #5 is the most popular, potent, and vigorous one; and Northern Lights #9 is a super-rare cut once held by Nevil Schoenmaker that was used to breed and then disappeared.With its longstanding history and popularity, Northern Lights is in high-demand in most legal cannabis markets. Since it can be hard to come by at the dispensary, many home growers enjoy cultivating Northern Lights. Selecting the right marijuana seeds is important when cultivating Northern Lights and growers who want consistent results should look for feminized Northern Lights seeds to ensure a reliable harvest.Thought to be of Afghani lineage, from the ""Basic #5? lineSee above — originated with the Super Sativa Seed Club, the earliest of the major seed banks.  It's since worked its way into hundreds of hybrids, making it one of the foundations of modern cannabis genetics.Piney and earthy, at times lightly sweet Piney, hashy, and earthy Very relaxing and indica-dominant effect, at times able to induce sleep.  A heavy head, heavy eyelids, and a smile are the main effects of this strain, making it a great nighttime selection.Grows well in hydro or soil, staying rather short and forming a single strong cola.  Great for SOG applications, it's also a low odor plant that's easy to grow for beginners thanks to its stature and disease/pest-resistance.Pacific Northwest of the USA, later to AmsterdamOriginally created as ""Basic #5? by the Super Sativa Seed Club, the precursor to Sensi Seeds — later was sold by Sensi itself45-50 days"

OG Kush x ChemDog,"The smell and taste for this one were absolutely top-notch — a great fusion of the two parent strains. We recommend this one as a daytime pick-me-up sort of med, as it provided good mental focus while making us feel very positive and relaxed. The initial potency was very strong, so inexperienced patients may want to take it easy at first.OG Kush x ChemDogOne of the best pre-grind smell samples we've had, it's ridiculously pungent in the jar, broadcasting its acrid skunky-fuel essence all over the room. Once ground, the overall stank seemed to calm down slightly, unleashing more measured Kush notes (spice, soil, pine, citrus). It seemed ChemDog-dominant overall though, with strong notes of gun oil, glue, and other sharp, chemmy smells.One of the best and most lastingly pungent tastes we've had in some time, this strain yielded a very strong chemical citrus attack, with some oddly flowery notes. The in-mouth taste was soil-heavy, with some citrus elements. On exhalation, a lingering aftertaste of gun oil and fuel complete this complex and pungent taste package.Quickly the face feels pressure fluctuations, the eyes lower, and waves of energy are felt throughout the body — there was some ""butterflies"" feeling and a little heart-racing to start. After that passed, it felt fairly functional mentally, but the body was reluctant to do much more than enjoy a seat and it took on a fairly direct Indica quality. Even that initial wave of potency wasn't all that strong though, and this was a manageable medication overall, making it suitable for many situations, whether they be social, solitary, or a little of both.ColoradoClone only"

The scent stuck with this bud very well and was quite pleasant. Familiar piney kush flavor, nice but lacking in amount.

Oh! Zone,"Oh! Zone looks extremely Indica in almost every way, from the dark coloration to the fat trichome heads, and the taste and smell carried that trend through, with a package of spicy, musky, and earthy qualities. We felt that the effects seemed to depend upon context a bit, as a morning review produced more of a moderate Indica hybrid experience, and a later session resulted in a more overt Indica feeling, with only the first 30 minutes to 1 hour feeling energizing or stimulating. The sleep aid properties that ended this experience were perhaps its greatest medical benefit, but the main effects serves to elevate mood a bit while helping with daily aches and tensions. Oh! Zone had a potent start that might be a little much for inexperienced patients, so we'd mark this in the mid-level patient category, primarily for evening use.Bred by Canada's Doctor Greenthumb SeedsArrowhead-shaped asparagus green sepals, arranged in tight stacked calyxes, snaked with shocks of rust colored pistils, and above average coverage with short thin-stemmed trichomes with large heads.Though this isn't an appealing smell in the sense that something fruity or sweet is, it appealed to the Indica-lovers in our staff, who recognized the musky, woody, spicy, earthy aromas it released as harbingers of a traditional type of Indica experience. It was a bit softer and more straight musky with slight pepper notes in the bag/jar, but when ground, it became sharper and a tad garlicky, with hints of pine and a major uptick in pungency level.Much like the pre-grind smell, the flavor was a spicy, vegetal, and earth-dominant experience, never tasting particularly distinct. The smoke was fairly pleasant and only made us cough on large hits due to expansion. The flavor did degrade to the point where it wasn't pleasurable by the end, but that's fairly standard amongst strains that aren't overtly flavorful from the outset. The initial effects of this strain, like many, seemed fairly Sativa in nature, serving to awaken us quite a bit just by changing the mental state slightly and causing physical effects in the head, face, and eyes along with the urge to move around in the seat or get up and walk around. We got some typical pressure increase in the facial areas as well as a cascading/waving body effect that was mostly concentrated in the neck, shoulders, and upper torso. An increased heartrate and some spatial distortion had us slightly overwhelmed at times early on, but that cleared up after about 30 minutes. The early energized effect evened out into a relaxing but somewhat cloudy-feeling mental state, where tasks could be accomplished, but tended to move more slowly and deliberately than normal. One reviewer amongst our group who reviewed in the morning hours found it to be not nearly as heavy, and the initial effects seemed to carry the energy level into the 2nd hour — the rest of us had a more short-lived ""up"" part of the experience. Relaxation builds after the first 1.5 hours or so, culminating in an outright sleepy state as it left us.CanadaSeed55-65 Days"

Some body attributes were present later on in the duration, but overall, this was a ""heady"" med that is best-suited for mental energy, mood, and ocular relief.Island Sweet Skunk x TrinityFat spade-shaped olivine sepals, arranged in stacked spiral calyxes, with frequent bursts of copper pistils, and above average coverage with short-stalked hooked trichomes with large headsNot exactly appealing in the sense that you want to smell it regularly, this strain was a combination of a slightly creamy vegetal sweetness along with a more putrid, fecal, ""cheese"" type of smell that made us wrinkle our collective nose. It hints at potency, but isn't terribly appealing to most people. The smell also weirdly seemed to disappear after a grinding rather than getting stronger.Much like the smell, the taste wasn't terribly appealing but wasn't bad either — it gave off a light, spicy citrus with some smooth, almost creamy notes present along with a floral (one reviewer said ""soapy"") quality. Contrary to many strains, this one seemed to taste better when you really go at it with the lighter rather than 'sipping' it, filling the mouth with a floral-tinged smoke.A very heavy and nearly overwhelming Sativa experience started this one off — the brow sweated, the heart rate jumped, and a rising pressure filled the brow/forehead/eye area. Mentally it had us full of energy but a bit spaced-out, at least initially. The initial potency only lasted about 30 minutes (probably a good thing, it was a little much even for our veteran review staff), fading into a focused state where we found ourselves swept up in a single task that seemed to go on unabated for hours. Though not exactly couchlocked, that was basically the end result, as the singular focus on sedentary work/activities kept us engaged throughout. Some enduring head pressure was the last physical remnant of this med, and it faded out cleanly with only a little bit of a drained feeling.ColoradoClone Only"
Papaya,"We really enjoyed this sample after not being overly excited to try it based on our experiences with Mango and its family in the past, as well as the reputation of Nirvana Seeds for putting out variations on other seedbank product. However, this particular Papaya really impressed us with its strong and lasting Indica-dominant effects which had us glued to the couch, but enjoying every minute of it. The musky and complex fruit smell and flavor really reminded us of Mango at times, and that added to the overall appeal.Bred by Nirvana Seeds to be a fast growing and disease resistant strain.Claw-shaped cucumber green sepals, arranged in tight cluster calyxes, with frequent bursts of paarl brown pistils, and average coverage with short wavy trichomes with large headsThis strain had a fruity and slightly musky smell to it which did indeed bring to mind mangoes, down to the complex-smelling skin with its musky qualities, which seemed to mostly be present pre-grind. Once it was ground, it took on a more directly sweet and floral fruity quality, keeping the mango scent mostly intact. This was a rather uncanny-smelling fruit strain, and one that impressed us, given that we had not really heard much about it in the past.Lightly sweet and fruity, the flavor was similar to the smell, but not quite as directly fruity, with more of an earthy bent on the inhale, converting to an almost peppery, spicy funk on the exhale. This complex-tasting strain certainly had tropical fruit elements, but it was mostly reminiscent of the earthy, spicy, and lightly fruity Afghani lines. The flavor was pleasantly sweet until mid-way though the bowl, but the smoke was also rather thick and expansive, causing some coughing at times.Though we did feel some Sativa effects such as a major increase in heart rate, this sample felt heavily Indica, though it was nicely functional at smaller dosages. The initial potency seemed to last a long time, keeping up at a high level through 1.5 hours, mostly putting us in a couchlocked state where the body literally felt heavy and pulled down but the mind was fairly active and engaged when prompted. Strong pain relief and muscle relaxation had our bodies feeling rather floppy and the waves emanating from the solar plexus kept up at a high level for almost an hour. A lasting euphoric feeling was the main mental effect we experienced, and we just generally felt very good the entire time we were medicated on this strain. As the effects cleared, we lifted ourselves off of the couch and regained some of our ability to focus, and there were no real lingering tired feeling or other negative side effects.Netherlands49-63 Days"

Phenom,"We wish we knew the origins of this strain so that we could better see where its potential lies medically — this one just seemed like it wasn't quite what it could be, and making judgments on the strain as a whole would be difficult. We saw huge potential in the smell/flavor package, which reminded us of some of our favorite fruity Hazes — but the iffy trim, overall ""blah"" visual appearance, and lack of visual trichomes knocked it down a peg. The effects were definitely Sativa-dominant, with a familiar Haze-influenced dream-like effect and some moderate muscle and mental relaxation. We sort of vacillated between active and sedative states, making the medical uses once again a little confusing and varied. We see this as a late daytime type of med for patients who want to retain functionality and energy but can still use a mental vacation.UnknownLong, thin spearhead shaped palm green calyxes, formed in loose closed clusters, with dark goldenrod pistils, and above average density of average-stalked trichomes with small headsThis strain really reminded our crew of something from the Jack Herer line, as it had that familiar (yet sweeter, more in the Jack Flash vein) citrus Haze aroma that we all love — another reviewer mentioned Dutch Durban as another similar aroma profile. It was certainly noticeable in the jar, but it really developed when it was handled or ground up, getting a little more aggressive and taking on an almost Diesel-like backing musk that competed with the sweetness for attention.Giving off a rather thick smoke, this strain mostly matched its aroma in the flavor, bringing a slightly more floral, eucalyptus-influenced flavor with many of the same citrus elements. It left a pleasantly hashy aftertaste in the mouth, and the actual flavor maintained well as it burned away. As mentioned, the smoke was rather thick, moderately harsh, and rather expansive — in short, you'll probably cough on this one from one or the other.About 5 minutes following the start of the review session, the typically Sativa onset of a buzzing body and changes in head/eye/face pressure set the tone for the majority of the experience. Our heads felt light and floaty, even a little disoriented or dizzy at times, while our bodies were lightly energized, buzzing strongly in the upper legs, forearms, and ears. A familiar Haze-influenced ""sensory blanket"" seemed to have us a little bit duller and slower than normal in a variety of mental processes, though the mood elevation it provided made us not particularly care. As it moved on, our bodies became more relaxed and it moved into the standard Sativa comedown, where the couch is more attractive than movement… this state seemed to go away and come back several times over the final 1.5 hours.ColoradoClone"

Pineapple Hashwreck,
Pink Pez,"The smell this strain possessed was pretty wonderful — basically the opposite end of most of the impressive-smelling samples we've had lately (most seem to be Diesel or Kush-dominant), it provided a wonderfully sweet candy-like aroma that still had a nice sharp quality to it. The appearance was very good as well, with lots of colors and great structure. Though the cannabinoid numbers came back kind of low, the initial potency actually felt rather strong and this strain held steady at medicinal levels for a solid 1.5 - 2 hours, which is very good. It might get on top of you a bit when it shifts gears mid-way through and gets heavy on the eyes, but the worst thing that would happen is an unexpected nap. We recommend this as a very good after-work relaxation med or one that leads into sleep; it was a quality Indica-dominant hybrid experience overall.Pezz x Sour Pink GrapefruitA rare clone only, the parents are a Pezz clone held by Apothecary Genetics in California and a Sour Pink Grapefruit male from Hortilab seedsClaw-shaped rain forest green open calyxes with maroon pistils, and long, thin stalked trichomes with medium headsThis was the only area where the name really seemed to fit the strain — the smell it produced reminded us of a sweet pink grapefruit. There were notes of citrus, pine, cherry candy, and flowers, and it was nicely pungent once ground up.While it wasn't a bad taste, we really struggled to get much of a read on this one. We got some sweet notes, some slightly spicy/floral notes, and that was about it. The smoke was smooth and enjoyable though, very easy to consume with it non-expansive nature and soft attack.The Pink Pez started out with a Sativa-feeling head attack, making our foreheads feel heavy and overbearing, as if we had a Neanderthal brow. The initial attack made it a bit hard to focus and there was a clear heart-racing that came on about 10 minutes into it, building in effect until its peak around 30 minutes. Though it was fairly social in nature, we think it would be a bit of a struggle to have a complex conversation with a stranger, etc. — best for easy-going company. A heavy body presence came over us after the initial effects receded — we felt relaxed and drawn to the couch… this stage could easily lead into sleep. Depending on the time of medication, you'll either shake yourself off and continue on with your day once this med brings you back to normal. or you'll be tired enough to just call it an early night.CaliforniaClone58-65 Days"

Pootie Tang,"LA Kush x Tang TangThe Pootie Tang strain was created in 2012 by New House Seed Co. – a joint venture between Tierra Rojo and Paco, two Colorado based growers. The strain is a cross between LA Kush, an indica dominant hybrid known for its relaxing and euphoric properties, and Tang Tang, a racy sativa strain derived from a Blue Sonja backcross. The strain is prevalent in Colorado but can be difficult to find in other states. Pootie Tang won 3rd place at the 2015 Denver Cannabis Cup for best sativa flower.Because this strain is available from both seed and clone, there are a variety of phenotypes floating around. Pootie Tang can take on an appearance that leans towards either one of the parents; however, the Tang Tang influence seems to be more pronounced. The Tang Tang parent brings sativa plant structure with elongated node structure, intense trichome coverage, and large fox-tailing colas. The clone-only LA Kush parent contributes bud density and a slightly darker green bud color. The sample we tested resembled the Tang Tang as opposed to the OG structure one might expect from the LA Kush influence.The variations in phenotype will also result in variations in smell. However, Pootie Tang can generally be described as earthy, hashy, and tangy. The smell is predominantly earthy, which is consistent with the aroma of each of the parents. The underlying tangy-ness is a mild citrus smell – like a fresh grapefruit as opposed to a ripe orange.Once again, flavor will vary between phenotypes; however, the taste can generally be described as dry, musty and slightly refreshing. The taste is predominantly earthy, which is consistent with both parents. The refreshing flavors can range from tangy (from the Tang Tang) to more piney (from the LA Kush). Despite the name, do not expect the flavor to be intensely ‘orange.'The powerful sativa qualities of the Tang Tang seem to make their way into nearly every Pootie Tang phenotype. Pootie Tang induces a strong head high with the classic frontal lobe sativa buzz. This strain can be somewhat of a ‘creeper’ with delayed effects that continue to increase in intensity over time. The LA Kush balances out the racy nature of the Tang Tang high. Overall, Pootie Tang induces a classic stoney sativa sensation that is concentrated in the head.Bred in ColoradoNew House Seed Co.

A very pretty purple strain that looked nicer than some others we've seen, with a typical purple in its color palette.  It was basically perfect texture-wise and was above-average in trichome coverage A very stinky and musky example of a Purple strain… the pungent musk carries notes of ""dark"" fruits like plums and grapes, which really came out after the grind.  In the jar it's got a nice skunkiness to it as well that adds to the pungency… an impressive bouquet overall, though a little on the ""impressive but not exactly pleasurable"" side due to the strong musk factorAn almost cotton candy/bubble gum purple sweetness Definitely strong in Sativa qualities for a purple strain, this one was almost buzzy and energetic throughout the body and behind the eyes.  That subsided fairly quickly though and turned into more of a passive pain relief quality, where one reviewer with back issues was able to work in the garden for nearly 2 hours with no pain to speak of, even after having spasms that morning.  Though it provided quality relief, it didn't possess much of an actual body feeling (i.e. buzzing, pulsing, warmth), which was a little unique.  It also seemed to have almost no effect on cognition… totally clear-headed and aware, which again is unusual for a purple strain.

Much like the smell, the flavor is a dark fruity musk with a bit of sweetness at times — a great blend of the typical purple flavor and traditional Afghani/Pakistani Kush varieties. Eminently relaxing and rather potent, Purple Kush is definitely in touch with its Afghani-Pakistani roots.  Coming on with a slight rush of energy, that subsides quickly and leaves the user with a floaty, highly medicated body experience that makes aches and pains as well as anxiety/stress melt away.  Purple Kush is also known for being a long-laster, normally going out to the 3 hour mark.  Recommended highly for body pain, muscle relaxation, mood elevation, appetite stimulation, and sleep aid at higher dosages. Grows well in soil or hydro — they all have fairly strong yield considering the possible Urkle lineage and traditionally slow vegetative growth of purple strains.  Cooler temperatures at night and a longer flowering time will help to bring out the purple coloration to a higher degree.Afghanistan/Pakistan mountains, bred and popularized in California, USAClone-only, the most famous and sought-after version is Kyle Kushman's Las Vegas Purple Kush, but there are also the ""Garberville Purple Kush""  and the ""SR71 Purple Kush"", all of which are different but have kept the Purple Kush name.Depends on the cut, but it's generally between 55 days at the absolute earliest and 70 days for the late-maturing cuts."

Surprisingly with the strong Indica-feeling attack, it was a fairly functional and clear effect, which we all appreciated (especially since the staff tends to not enjoy the often groggy-feeling Purple strains). The body high was extremely evident from the beginning and stayed fairly constant, but the lingering eyes feeling and a slight burst of energy returning to a sober state were the epilogue of this strain's effects.

S.A.G.E.,"S.A.G.E. stands for ""Sativa-Afghani Genetic Equilibrium"", indicating that the mission for this plant was to provide the best of both worlds.  Many believe that's the case, as this plants has been extremely popular, with some elite selections being grown, cloned, and passed around for 10+ years now.  While it is certainly a hybrid, S.A.G.E. is clearly Sativa-dominant, with some phenotypes going out to 80 days flowering.  Its Haze-heavy mother shines through in the effect and the appearance.Big Sur Holy x AfghaniA very special Hazy Sativa plant grown at a monastery in the Big Sur area of California (later known as ""Big Sur Holy Weed"") is the mother to this line.  Adam Dunn used his workhorse Afghani male to balance out the rangy Holy Weed and provide better structure as well as a more palatable flowering time.  S.A.G.E. is considered as T.H.Seeds' flagship strain and is one of Dunn's favorites to this day, being entered as recently as 2012 into the High Times Denver Medical Cannabis Cup's Sativa category.  A couple of special S.A.G.E. cuts are out in the clone scene currently, with the ""FoCo S.A.G.E."" (out of Ft. Collins, Colorado) perhaps being the most sought-after for its incredible Sativa effect and punchy, spice-heavy aroma.The plant itself tends to grow with pointed colas which bulk up considerably by finish, with some getting into the ""soda can"" realm.  The long pistils and large calyxes  make this one fairly easy to trim and also makes for a smooth, easy smoke thanks to the lack of leaves.  Lime green with creamy orange pistils, the trichomes tend to be shorter with large, bulbous heads and medium-thick coverage overall.A spicy Haze scent with notes of sandalwood, bay leaves, garlic, and a light Dutch Haze type of sweetness at times, which comes through heavily in certain phenotypes.Though the quicker-finishing Afghan-heavy phenotypes are at times sweet, the flavor of the most prized cuts is similar to its namesake, with a bouquet of spice-like flavors with a fresh nature — this one tastes like a true Sativa, reedy and clean on the palate with an expansive but smooth smoke.A true hybrid, it starts out strongly Sativa, with an increase in eye/face pressure, an uptick in heart rate, and racing, at-times disjointed thoughts.  While not incapacitating mentally, it does slow things down simply because the mind is being pulled in many different directions, following flights of fancy and craving interaction.  Good for creative pursuits but not as much for settled, detail-oriented work, this one is most conducive to spending a day having fun outside or an evening being productive at home.  The body effects also tend to start off rather early, warming the limbs and core and relaxing the muscles so that they feel loose and floppy.  This is a great daytime strain, giving a boost of energy and also relieving body tension and mental stress, a mostly-functional strain perfect for those who stop just short of the raciest, most cerebral varietals.Responds well to training, more than doubles its height in flowering.  Produces well and will continue throwing out white pistils if fed any type of nitrogen in flowering — this is acceptable though, as the extra bulk overall is worth the additional time.California, USA, then to Amsterdam, The NetherlandsT.H.Seeds70-80 days"

Silver Pearl,"Though it won a Cannabis Cup way back in 1994, we didn't expect a whole lot from this strain, simply because it's very old-school and contains strains that make our collective shoulders shrug. However, this strain showed us that old Dutch seedbank material has its good points, as it provided a great Sativa-hybrid experience and a huge dose of fresh, sweet, fruity notes in both the flavor and the aroma. This particular grow was mostly without flaw, and we especially liked seeing the array of cloudy trichomes, which seems increasingly rare (we often see a bunch of clear heads with patches of ambers mixed in rather than a true progression). While its strong start and at times racy effect may get on top of some inexperienced patients, it was moderately potent overall and would be suitable for daytime relief for mid-to-experienced patients. This is a strong first KindReview for Green Mountain CARE, and we look forward to seeing more choices from their garden.Bred by Sensi Seeds to create an easy-to-grow stress-resistant varietal for indoor cultivationClaw-shaped asparagus green sepals, arranged in tight closed cluster calyxes, with bursts of burnt umbre pistils, and average coverage with thick-stalked wavy trichomes with large headsWe were almost taken aback at how nice this sample smelled, both in the jar/bag and once it was broken up or ground. It reminded us of some of the better Jack Herer/Jack Flash samples we've had, except with more of the candy sweetness you find in something like Island Sweet Skunk or Cotton CandyRomulan. Sweet, fruity, and floral, it has elements of rose petals, grape candy, and fresh citrus cleaner — these aromas seem to blend and appear at different times, making for a complex and enjoyable experience. While not outwardly pungent like something in the Diesel/Kush family, it was a strong and bold aroma nonetheless.While it's worth noting that one reviewer didn't seem to care much for the flavor and noted some harshness when burning, the rest of the staff had no such complaints. We got a very fresh, lightly sweet and fruity flavor that seemed to match the pre-grind smell for the most part. It had notes of eucalyptus, citrus, and flowers on the initial hits but burned away into more of a lightly spicy (yet still sweet) flavor that brought to mind cinnamon. The smoke was extremely smooth for the majority of the staff (one using a glass pipe, one using an IncrediBowl) and coughing was minimal. The final ash finished with some dark areas, indicating that a longer or more thorough flush would have been beneficial… that didn't affect the flavor much in our estimation, however.The effects of this strain were noticed almost immediately after exhaling, with the usual package of Sativa pressure effects rising up into our heads. A fluttery, light feeling in the torso area and an major uptick in both mood and mental activity also added to the Sativa start we experienced. It bordered on anxious at times, but its background body relaxation seemed to help keep us calm and in a positive, borderline euphoric mood. While it was difficult to concentrate on one thing, it seemed to aid with overall mental activity, making some of the staff feel like multi-tasking machines, jumping capably from task to task but never lingering. The fairly excitable state declined in potency after about an hour, then shifted gears at about 1.5 hours to a more relaxing state that lost the at-times anxious edge. The effect's endurance was also somewhat surprising, lasting at a medicinal level for 2 solid hours, then declining quickly from there but lingering in the eyes for a full 3 hours.NetherlandsSeed"

SK9 seemed to go with the flow of the day, making us feel comfortable and capable at nearly any project we took on. The second half came with some drowsiness, but a quick re-medication would fix that. The crisp Haze-influenced aroma and taste were both pleasing, if a bit indistinct, and we had no real complaint about the appearance. We like this strain as a daytime motivator, or perhaps as an after-work ""up-then-down"" type of med, where you can get things done and then ease into a relaxing night.Spade-shaped woodland green sepals, arranged in closed stack calyxes, with bursts of ocher pistils, and above-average coverage with short-stalked hooked trichomes with large headsSweet and spicy, this strain's Skunk lineage was evident from the start. Though it wasn't an overtly pungent strain, it definitely made its presence known, especially when broken apart. This reminded us of some old school strains for sure, with a fresh quality that brought to mind some of the Haze Skunk hybrids such as Jack Herer. Crisp and fresh, it had a taste that almost reminded us of sweet peppers, with some spicy qualities and a hint of sweetness. The smoke was super-smooth and caused almost no coughing, hitting the throat softly and not expanding much at all. After finishing the review samples, we became immediately alert-feeling, energized, and motivated to complete various household tasks. While it did lower the eyelids and redden the eyes a bit, there were no other noticeable signs of being medicated, as we felt completely capable in complex conversations and tasks. While this one wasn't a total pain reliever, there was some element of relief, mainly in the neck and shoulder areas. As it progressed beyond 1.5 hours, it definitely became more sedate and relaxing, even bordering on tiring. This is a common occurance with very ""uppy"" strains, as going back to normal often seems like a dip, when it's really just returning to the median.Clone"
Skunk #1,
Skunk #1 x Northern Lights #5,"With plenty of hybrid vigor and great commercial potential, this cross of two classics is recommended for commercial growers due to its yield and its easy manicuring.Skunk #1 x Northern Lights #5Normally Skunk-dominant, with a fruity and pungent aroma, it also has hints of the more earthy and piney Northern Lights #5. Fairly neutral blend of slight sweetness, pine, and earthy flavors. Sedative and feeling rather Indica-dominant, this strain is good for relaxation, sleep aid, and minor pain relief.  The Sativa components of the Skunk seem to have been mostly bred out for commercial purposes… this feels like almost a straight-up Indica with its relaxing and near-tiring effect. Grows well in either soil or hydro, good for SOG applications if un-topped, can easily be trained into whatever shape is desired.Amsterdam, The NetherlandsThe Seed Bank of Holland"
Skunk #2,
Skywalker OG,"While the overall potency and somewhat steep fall-off around 1.5 hours left us wishing for slightly more potency overall, it seems that part of that was due to the overall clarity of the experience — it never felt overbearing or pushy. The smell and taste package are something that most Kush-lovers will fawn over and while it had minimal body effects, it instilled a sense of calm focus that lent itself nicely to quiet work projects.OG Kush x Sour DieselA sativa-leaning OG Kush phenotype that appeared in the California clone scene circa 2003.  Often confused with the Dutch Passion strain, Skywalker, this phenotype (also called Sativa OG), is said to have gotten its moniker after being largely propagated by a grower named Luke.Spearhead shaped dark olive green calyxes tipped in mortar gray/purple in places, formed in open clusters, with dark brown pistils, and an above average density of long, average stalked trichomes with average headsA pungent earthy citrus OG Kush reek with a lightly sweet finish.Slightly floral sharp citrus with a creamy finish.A slight haze or cloudy feeling comes over the eyes almost immediately, also causing some pressure fluctuations in that area — there was also a pleasant headband/hat-area buzzing that had us feeling quite good immediately. Despite that eye haze, the mental state was very clear throughout, even during the period of initial potency. A clear, vibrant, relaxing OG.CaliforniaClone-only55-65 Days"

Snow Wreck,"A fusion of two of the California medical scene's most potent Sativa clone-only varieties Trainwreck and Snowcap, Snow Wreck is a heavily Sativa strain that fills the user with energy while also knocking them to the couch.Snowcap x TrainwreckSnowcap is a Northern California medical scene clone thought to have lineage in the Haze family of plants, while Trainwreck is a legendary California strain thought to have Mexican Sativa and Afghani roots.Seems Snowcap dominant, with a fruity-pine scent that carries traces of the Trainwreck's menthol-citrus when ground up. Piney and fresh, it has a Haze-dominant taste profile. Strong and cerebral to start, it can leave the user stuck to the couch simply due to not knowing what to do with themselves.  The Afghani lineage in the Trainwreck is the only thing keeping this strain from feeling completely Sativa, as there is a warming body component.  Potent and long-lasting, Snow Wreck is recommended as a daytime med for those who enjoy strongly Sativa experiences.  Benefits with nerve issues, ocular relief, and appetite stimulation. Trainwreck is known for being unstable and throwing out hermie flowers late in flowering, and this cross of two clone-only females would likely be even more unstable in that sense… use caution.California, USAClone onlyWould anticipate 75+ days based on lineage"

SnowDawg,
Sour Diesel,"Thought to be an accidental cross when the DNL hermied, Sour Diesel (or East Coast Sour Diesel, as it's commonly called) is a special plant in the OG Kush/ChemDawg line of strains.  Its often ""crushing"" sativa effect actually seems to hit most people as more of an indica, increasing couchlock and being strong to the point of being overwhelming at times.  The plant itself is a fairly lanky one that tends to show lots of foxtailing when finished, practically stinking up the room with its pungent fuel-skunk-citrus bouquet.Unconfirmed, thought to be Original Diesel (ChemDawg '91 x [Massachusetts Super Skunk x Sensi Seeds Northern Lights] x DNL (Northern Lights/Shiva x Hawaiian)When Original Diesel was accidentally crossed with a DNL plant that hermied, it created seed stock that produced the East Coast Sour Diesel (ECSD) clone.  Many seed companies have released crosses with the strain, and some (like Reservoir Seeds) have attempted to reproduce the strain in seed form, releasing a variety of backcrosses and IBLs with varying results.Sour Diesel displays an extremely pungent blend of fuel, skunk, citrus, and spice that will leak through many jars and bags when the strain is well-grown.  The sharpness gets stronger after breaking it up, adding a stronger kick of citrus as well as a cutting fuel aroma that tickles the nose.A frontal attack of skunky citrus funk gives way to a mentholated lime-kissed spice which lingers in the mouth.  The smoke is expansive and will definitely cause coughing on larger hits.Sour Diesel is fairly sativa-dominant but seems to exhibit a headslam of an indica effect at times, especially if let go late into flowering.  It hits the eyes and head immediately, filling them with pressure and energy, while the body seems almost immobile at times, trending heavily towards couchlock — a numbing quality is also often reported, aiding with nerve and muscle pain relief.Sour Diesel isn't known for being a long-laster at medicinal levels — it's a high peak and then a valley normally, often finishing with the user feeling lethargic and a bit drained after the sativa start.  Sour Diesel often helps with nerve issues, appetite, and can also help as a sleep aid during the ""crash"" portion of the effects. Sour Diesel doesn't yield quite as well as Original Diesel, growing a bit more spindly and with lighter buds, but the yield is still above-average.  Training and netting works very well for this strain, and it will take moderate to high amounts of feeding during flower, bulking up until the very end.  It stretches at least twice its initial height when flowered, more than that without training.East Coast of the United StatesClone only, though Reservoir Seeds, Cali Connection, and a few others have since ""selfed"" the ECSD clone to produce feminized seed stockAbout 75 days, can go as long as 85 days for a less uppy experience — the fuel and funk seems to come out later in flower while the citrus elements are present early on."
Sour Grape,"Different from the Gage Green Grape Stomper which was renamed ""Sour Grapes"" by Blue Sky Collective in Oakland, this cut is from Apothecary Genetics and is their Grape Ape crossed with a Sour Diesel.  The hybrid produces larger nugs than the Ape and demonstrates the hybrid vigor one would expect from such a cross.  The mottled purple coloration and tangy sour grape-meets flowers aroma is immediately enticing to users, while the flavor and potent effects keep them coming back for more.Grape Ape x Sour DieselBred by Apothecary Genetics from their Grape Ape mother, this strain is often confused with ""Sour Grapes"", an alternate name for Gage Green Genetics' ""Grape Stomper"", an entirely different cross.  This confusion has not stopped either strain from gaining major popularity in both the California and Colorado medical markets.Sour Grape has shown promise in relief of digestive problems, nausea, anxiety, and mooderate muscle tension.  It also stimulates the appetite quite a bit while improving mood in an even-handed manner, making it suitable for patients seeking versatile relief for either day or night.Like its parent strain Grape Ape, Sour Grapes tends to be a mottled purple rather than turning entirely purple, with a collection of soft almost pastel-like colors blending into a harmonious whole.  The nugs are of medium density thanks to a bit of Sativa influence added from the Diesel, but they still mostly retain the Grape Ape shape and overall structure.  Trichome coverage is above average but there is still enough room to let the color shine through (it doesn't look white to the naked eye).An engaging mix of the two parent strains, Sour Grapes has a fairly soft grape sweetness in the bag but blows up into a complex sour fruit aroma with hints of flowers and incense lingering in the background.  It doesn't tend to have outward Diesel elements, but the added sharpness can definitely be detected among the Grape-dominant package of smells.Sweet and sour grape dominates the flavor, and the Diesel takes a definite backseat, never really being picked up except in that the taste is unlike the standard Grape Ape.  It has an expansive, thick smoke which can often cause coughing.As would be expected with the parental lineage, the effects feel almost like a 50/50 hybrid of Indica and Sativa, with both seemingly coexisting peacefully rather than pulling the patient one way then another.  A balanced mix of facial and head effects blend with a buzzing body that tends to be most comfortable when immobile, resulting in a relaxed but mentally-aware state that is suitable and fairly productive for sedentary mental tasks, but not particularly suited to more strenuous activity.  It hits hard early on and then peters out quite a bit after the hour mark, converting into more of a base relaxation but still retaining mental clarify and not reaching into the heavy, sleepy end of the Indica spectrum.A robust plant, Sour Grape branches well and responds positively to SCROG setups but can also be grown untopped for a fairly large single cola and moderate side growth.  This plant can take fairly heavy feedings and grows equally well in soil or hydroponic setups.California, USAApothecary Genetics55 to 62 days"

Sour Willie,"This one is definitely a daytime med, getting the mind moving but still having some body effects to go along with the predominantly head-neck-shoulders Sativa effects package.The Willie Nelson father is Highland Nepalese x Vietnamese BlackBroad arrowhead-shaped wasabi green sepals, arranged in foxtailed stacked calyxes, with bursts of piper red pistils, and above-average coverage with average-stalked trichomes with large headsA pungent Diesel presence was in the forefront when this strain was sitting in the jar/bag, with a skunky and slightly acrid scent propelling a hint of citrus. When we ground it up, the Diesel elements seemed to fade away, giving instead a lightly sweet and complex aroma with hints of fruit and spice. The change was unexpected and refreshing, because Sour Diesel seems to completely take over so many crosses.The flavor was a bit confusing and not as pungent as the aroma, giving us a sharp attack with just a hint of Diesel, then basically leaving behind a clean, fresh, mentholated feeling in the mouth rather than much of a taste. The smoke was smooth and didn't cause coughing except on the largest hits, while the flush appeared to be nearly perfect, leaving behind only a fluffy white ash. This one was enjoyed by all and was repeatedly described as ""pleasant"", but just didn't wow us with a pungent flavor.This strain hit us with an almost entirely Sativa package of effects, increasing both the mental and physical energy of our staff, filling us with a buzzing body and head presence. Facial warmth, ocular/temple pressure, some body numbing, and a racing heart continued through most of the initial hour, eventually backing off slightly into a less racy and cerebral state. We found conversation easy when it was around, but it was also easy to get stuck in your own head so to speak, staring off in space while deep in thought, or zoning in on a project and shutting out the outside world. The buzzing body continued throughout most of the experience and served to make this a fairly versatile med in terms of context, making us equally satisfied with activities or relaxation. A smooth decline in effect left us feeling relaxed but still aware, with no real crash to speak of.ColoradoClone"

Stardawg,"Chem-4 x Tres DawgChem 4 was an original seed popped after a Grateful Dead tour 1991 when two guys from Colorado networked with a fellow fan from Masachusetts. One ounce of supreme quality ""Dog Bud"" (the nickname given to the original plant, possibly originating in Oregon) had a handful of seeds. Of those seeds, one was Chem Dog 4. An allstar of it's own, it was bred to Tres Dawg, a Chem Dog exclusive breeding project. By compounding desired traits in the flowers, Stardawg is remarkably dense, pungent and stoney.Sprouting from perhaps the most influential strain in the modern cannabis market, Stardawg is the cumulation of two Chem Dawg (Chem Dog) strains, of which also spawned from exclusive Chem Dog breeding projects. The legend of Chem Dog, later named Chem Dawg by Top Dawg Seeds, is grand and since the early 90's the strain has become a common ancestor of most strains enjoyed in the 21st century.Stardawg has a dense, velvety texture. Large buds are common in growth and unlike other Chem Dog strains, hold together with minimal stem weight and have an original Skunk #1 appeal.Stardawg is alarmingly potent in chemical, acidic and pine fragrances. Like it's counterparts in the Chem Dog family, It truly smells like a dead skunk and has a very pevasive odor.The musk lingering in the ambient aroma translates directly to flavor, where one may have a salivating or lip smacking reaction when consuming. Thus, it's a favorite for processing into concentrates and the lineage of Chem Dog has spread to most modern day strains.Categorized as a sativa-dominant hybrid, Stardawg has varying effects, mostly relying on personal preference as a guide. For some, Chem Dog strains, and Stardawg in particular, gives a very uplifting, motivational experience most commonly found in sativas. Conversely, some will feel a lethargic ambivalent reaction that is typically enjoyed with indicas. As a result, different shops and seed companies market Chem Dog and Stardawg as indicas or sativas. It's a safe bet to expect a rich THC experience as it typically tests above average compared to other strains.The orignal Chem Dog(s) were born from a bag of ""Dog Bud"" brought from Colorado to Massachusetts. Dog Bud is believed to be an unknown strain from Oregon from the 1980's or perhaps even before. From there, Top Dawg Seed Company has proliferated the lineage to extreme popularity. It is rumored that there are still a few original Chem Dog seeds yet to be germinated.A result of successive breeding projects of Chem Dog (or Chem Dawg), Stardawg is an elite clone-only strain that exemplifies the most desired traits from the original from back in the early 90's."

Strawberry Haze,"The sweet Swiss Sativa on the mother's side gives this strain its distinct sugary berry aroma and taste, while the workhorse NL #5 x Haze on the ""father's side"" (this is feminized stock, so it was also a female plant) adds robust growth and vigor while reducing overall size.  With tight internodal spacing, it is a solid choice for Haze lovers who don't want a gigantic plant that is impossible to keep contained indoors.  The structure also tends to be fairly linear, making it a good choice for SOG methods and other vertical growing.Swiss Sativa x (Northern Lights #5 x Haze C), also called ""Arjan's Strawberry Haze""Created by Arjan, Green House's master breeder during the period of 2000-2004, it was finally released to rave reviews in 2006.Saccharine sweet strawberry + melons + flowers aroma, one of the sweetest-smelling sativas you'll find. Slightly less pronounced than the smell, the flavor is still almost identical to the aroma, with its candy-like fruit flavor lasting through the majority of the dosage. Energetic without being rushy, this is a social, creative type of sativa that elevates mood and sparks the mind. Tastes best in soil but produces best in hydro, like many strains.  Grows very well outdoors and finished mid-October in Northern hemispheres, often as a massive 7 ft. bush.Amsterdam, The NetherlandsGreen House Seed Company, available as feminized seed stock onlyAbout 75 days"
Strawberry Kush,"Smelling fruity and sweet, the Sour Diesel elements seem to come through more on the smoke, chasing off the berry notes.  Several versions exist, but the most common version is a mellow Sativa that gets its smell from the Strawberry Cough and its appearance and flavor primarily from the Sour Diesel/Kush side of the family.Strawberry Cough x Raspberry Kush x Sour Diesel — multiple versions appear to exist, as Strawberry Cough x OG Kush and OG Kush x California Indica (from Royal Dutch Genetics) are also listed in various sourcesSweet and fruity, very much reminiscent of the strawberry and raspberry genetics — only a hint of sharpness Spicy and Kush-dominant, lacking the fruitiness that was present in the smell. Sort of a dual experience, this feels like a true hybrid in that it has a buzzing Sativa body energy but the mental state is supremely relaxed.  It seemed to affect the face and eyes rather heavily, making it feel slightly tiring at times despite the body never feeling drowsy.  It was a worthy strain for pain distraction but didn't seem to actually relieve it.  Appetite stimulation, general relaxation, and ocular attention are the main medical benefits — recommended as an anytime sort of medicine, only at higher doses would it get to the overwhelming area. California, USAClone only, though Royal Dutch Genetics offers a seed version of Strawberry Kush… it's not the known cross though and is OG Kush x California Indica, making it Indica-dominant.Around 65-70 days for the Sativa-dom version"
Sugar Cookie,"The smell is something very unique that most of us hadn't encountered previously, a very refreshing and complex aroma that reminded us of other strains but always threw a wrench into the mix with an unexpected whiff of something. The effects were certainly Indica-dominant in the ""stoned"" vein where sitting on the couch relaxing and staring blankly at a movie seems like a great idea, making this a highly recommendable evening medication. It's great for unwinding at the end of the day without being incapacitated and serves to prepare the body and mind for a night of restful sleep.In-house strain bred by Grasshopper Wellness in ColoradoClaw shaped fern green calyxes , formed in tight closed clusters, with robin red pistils, and an above average density of average length, thin stalked trichomes with large heads, and a carpet of peltate trichomesThis strain has a very unique aroma that brought to mind a variety of sharp yet sweet scents. A burst of lime-kissed cleaner meets a sugary cherry syrup quality — it's certainly very sweet but the freshness and sharpness adds a complex dimension that was not noticed before breaking/grinding it up. Top-notch aroma here, and very unique.The initial flavor was much like the smell — a more flowery and smooth version of the lime-pine-sweetness combination. As the taste progressed though, it took on more of a holiday spice + anise quality, with an interesting sharp muskiness. The flavor degraded quite a bit th0ugh as it progressed, making us cough quite a bit and leaving a slightly funky aftertaste. Flush-wise, it could definitely use some work, as the final ash was a somewhat murky dark gray for most of the review staff.This strain started off with a little mental boost, serving to slap us awake a little bit with its potency. There were a strange package of pressure effects with this one, with multiple reviewers reporting strong jaw, ear, and forehead pressure — the ears were especially unique, as they were both warm and pressurized. Beyond the odd physical sensations with this one, it moved quickly into an Indica state of goofy, slightly lazy relaxation where mental function was intact, but just barely. Definitely a couchy movie-watching type of strain, though even concentrating on something like that might be a little more difficult than normal. Dropping in effect quite a bit after 1.5 hours, it had a smooth comedown that left us feeling relaxed and ready for bed, depending on the timing of medication.ColoradoClone55-65 Days"

Super Lemon Haze,"With its strong and sweet lemon qualities in both the smell and taste, this strain certainly lives up to its reputation and name when well-grown.  With the indica lineage present in the sativa-dominant hybrid, it results in a rather calm experience for a haze-based strain — rather balanced between head and body effects overall.  The plant grows with short internodes and responds well to topping.  The standard shape for the untrained plant is a Christmas tree-style sativa, with solid buds that have a high calyx-to-leaf ratio.Lemon Skunk (Green House used the original Vegas Lemon Skunk clone) x Super Silver Haze (Skunk #1 x Haze C) x (Northern Lights #5 x Haze C)The Lemon Man is the holder of the original Lemon Skunk mother, which has roots reaching back nearly 20 years into the Las Vegas-area growing community.Thought to be an original Sacred Seeds Skunk #1 release with a special lemony scent and flavor, the original Lemon Skunk made its way to Amsterdam and into the hands of Arjan, Green House Seeds' chief breeder.  He crossed it with a spectacular and highly Sativa-looking Super Silver Haze male, and as they say, ""the rest is history…""Strongly citrusy (lemon peel, grapefruit), often smelling sweet like Lemonheads candy — the Haze elements come through in the form of a flowery and spicy undertone.Rather lemony with some flowery elements, almost identical to the smell when grown properly.A motivational, creative, mood-elevating experience, Super Lemon Haze also comes with an array of body effects.  A buzzing, relaxed body that feels capable makes the elevated mood especially enjoyable.  This is a great daytime outdoorsy strain, perfect for a summer day spent doing activities or simply enjoying the day.  The medicinal qualities include: mood elevation, anti-anxiety, body relaxation, ocular attention, creativity, and appetite stimulation.Works well indoors or out, and works well in high-EC hydro or soil setups.  Soil tends to bring out more of the lemon flavor and smell.  Plants grow tall but respond well to topping.Amsterdam, NetherlandsGreen House Seeds9-10 weeks"

Super Silver Lights,"We appreciated how smooth the whole experience felt, from the pleasantly cool and mentholated smoke to the steadiness of the mood elevation and ocular effects. This one fits somewhere in the functional daytime Indica category at lower dosages, but creeps into the nighttime Indica category when the dosage is stepped up, and especially without remedication, as the end of the experience was fairly tiring for our staff.Fat arrowhead-shaped olive drab sepals, arranged in loose cluster calyxes, with frequent bursts of light ochre pistils, and average coverage with long thin-stalked wavy trichomes with average headsThe crisp, clean, fresh-smelling aroma that this strain produced definitely brought to mind both of the parents, as well as other strains such as Colorado Cough, Snowcap, and other NL #5/Haze variants. It almost tingles the nose with a mentholated flowery sweetness, getting quite a bit more pungent when it's broken apart.The flavor was almost exactly like the aroma, which is normally a good sign in our minds. Clean and smooth, it was a little sweet going in and left behind a flowery, mentholated aftertaste which left the mouth feeling fresh and the lungs breathing easy. The fluffy light gray and white ash left behind was further evidence of the proper flush, dry, and cure that this sample appeared to have received.The initial effects of this one were Sativa in nature for the majority of our staff, serving to wake up our minds a bit and just provide a little jolt to the system due to the potency. We also got some early facial effects (specifically in the jaw and eye areas, strangely enough) and an immediate mood elevation, which had use feeling functional and content. After the first 30-45 minutes, the experience took a heavy turn for one of our reviewers, where he was almost falling asleep on the couch mid-evening (a rarity), due in large part to the at times heavy eye effects, which made them feel sunken, heavy, and a little dry. The other reviewers didn't get to the point of falling asleep, but it did start feeling heavier in general, providing quite a bit of relaxation, both mentally and physically. For an Indica-dominant hybrid, the end of this one felt suspiciously similar to the ""crash"" that one often feels at the end of a high-octane Sativa experience, leaving us a bit drained and tired, but still mentally positive and happy.ColoradoClone"

Very strong off the bat, with a spacey mental state and the urge to just sit and soak in the world, this strain is certainly above-average in potency.  A Sativa effects package to start with lots of head/eye pressure fluctuations, changes in visual perception, and a boost of energy.  Despite the potency, it leaves you able to focus if needed, generally on one task at a time.  It shifts gears around the 2 hour mark, converting into more of a sedating experience with solid body relaxation properties.

Sweet Afghani Delicious,"Unexpectedly sweet and fruity, this strain will certainly please those patients who place smell on the top of their list of qualities to look for. But even if that's not your thing, the effects were genuinely enjoyed by all of the staff, especially as a late-day or night-time med when relaxation is the goal. A very interesting strain indeed, though we wish the duration was a little longer.Bred by Sweet Seeds in Spain to be a sweet-smelling high-yielding Indica with good resistance to fungus and disease, they self-pollinated an award winning Black Domina held since 1998.Spearhead shaped avocado green calyxes, formed in loose closed clusters, with copper pistils, and an average density of long, thin-stalked trichomes with average heads, and lithocysts protruding.Totally unexpected except for that it was in the name, this strain was extremely sweet-smelling, reminding us of movie theater red rope licorice or a strawberry fruit roll-up — wonderful sweet, fruity scent with no trace of the normal musk seen in the parent strains. Truly a top-notch smell package for people who like sweet and fruity… the pungency is quite remarkable as well.Though one reviewer picked up some sweetness, this one was thought to be mainly earthy and much more reminiscent of the usual Afghani varietals. This one had a variety of woodsy and earthy tastes but also a twang that reminded one reviewer of fancy cheeses. It was a rather smooth smoking experience but left a medium gray ash and likely could've used a slightly longer flush.Truly a pure Indica/Afghani experience, this strain provided great relaxation properties throughout the body and mind, but especially in the upper back/shoulder/neck area, which felt particularly nice. A creeping head effect (one reviewer mentioned a ""headband feeling"") was mostly concentrated in the eyes and also led to a slightly slow and goofy mental state with an elevated mood. Once the main potency passed, it felt extremely functional though relaxing, finishing back at a normal energy level.SpainSeed56-63 Days"

Tangerine Haze,"A very special phenotype of Soma's original NYCD x G-13/Haze, Tangerine Haze was discovered by the Devil's Harvest Krew in 2003-04 and has since become something of a legend, especially in Colorado.  The plant is one of the most uncanny-smelling fruity strains on the planet, smelling and tasting exactly like a freshly-peeled tangerine, down to the sensation of the semi-bitter skin.  It grows tall and vigorously, forming strong creamy-orange colas that perfume the room.Original Soma Seeds New York City Diesel x G-13/HazeScott of Rare Dankness, speaking on the strain's genesis:One of the most often overlooked elements of the DHK was the ability of its members to grow out multiple identical packs of seeds, compare the best females in order to find true keepers. The DHK ""Tangerine Haze"" is one such example.  Members picked up the original G13/Haze x NYCD from Soma Seeds in 03-04 and over the next year each grew out his pack of seeds, compared the best females, and it was obvious which female stood out (at least in flavor). Nicknamed Tangerine Haze, this strain is still fairly hoarded even though it has been passed freely for the last couple of years. You guys can thank Erawk for that find!""The strain made its way from the West Coast of Canada to Boulder and Nederland, Colorado, where it became something of a legend among the growers and connoisseurs of the area.The smell of Tangerine Haze is legendary as being one of the few fruit-named strains that is a perfect replica of its namesake, filling the sinuses with a pungent and uncanny tangerine smell with a floral backdrop.  If it's let go beyond 65 days, it often takes on an astringent quality, so most growers like to take her down early if anything.The flavor is almost more tangerine-heavy than the scent, even going as far as to give the flavor of the semi-bitter skin or citrus zest along with the fresh citrus attack.  The flavor tends to linger in the mouth and sinuses for a long time after consumption, which increases the already amazing taste appeal of this strain.Tangerine Haze isn't the strongest strain around, but it lives up to its Haze name, uplifting the user's mindstate and filling the body and mind with a buzzing energy.  Great for creative pursuits, outdoor activities, and anything that can be enhanced with a slight shift of perspective - Tangerine Haze is a wonderful daytime strain that leaves the user feeling capable and at-ease mentally.Tangerine Haze grows tall and works best when it's flowered early on from clone, when the plant is approximately 10"" and has just established itself.Amsterdam, The Netherlands, bred and selected in North America by the ""Devil's Harvest Krew""Elite clone-only variety65 days, it tends to lose some of the tangerine quality if let go beyond that point"
Tangerine OG,
Thai Passion,"Like many Sativas, this one hit our staff a bit differently depending on the time of day and incoming mood — your experience may vary according to the same. It's definitely a strong Sativa though, which we would probably peg at around 85%… the effects package was almost entirely mental and/or body energy. While the taste was a bit confusing, the rest of the appeal categories were definitely above-average, displaying very traditional Sativa structure and texture that's always nice to see. We recommend this to those patients who are looking for a Sativa to give them a boost of energy but don't mind a possible bit of anxiousness — depending on how it affects you, your mental state should still be active and engaged… whether or not the body follows along is another matter.Bred by Bald Monkey seeds to be an early-finishing autoflowering Sativa variety Not very pungent in the jar at all, this strain had a sweet-sour and slightly putrid tropical fruit bouquet when ground up, reminding one reviewer of papaya. This was a fairly unique smell, though not pungent enough to be all that impressive.The majority of reviewers picked up on darker sweet flavors, such as roasted marshmallows, coffee, and nuts… but one reviewer (using an Incredibowl) caught a faint distinct yet disitinct fruit skin taste that danced peach skin that and grapefruit peel as the bowl burned. Rushy thoughts immediately crept into our heads as this medication took hold, energized and borderline anxious with mental energy as well as a physical buzzing throughout the body. It could certainly be described as ""heart-racing"" at first — it really felt strongly Sativa from the outset, hitting the eyes and head with lots of pressure fluctuations as well and inducing a cerebral, philosophical, and slightly psychedelic mental state. Our team was a bit split on the rest of the experience, with half of us reporting a fairly functional (yet rushy and a bit spacey) energy and the other half feeling mentally energetic but not feeling like doing much of anything. We all agreed that it left us a bit drained after the fact though, as it returned us to a normal energy level, then dipped below that to the point where we were actually drowsy-feeling.DenmarkSeed64-71 Days"

The Prophet,"The Tang Tang is from Grindhouse Medical Seeds' Sonja line (derived from Blockhead but Sativa-dominant) and adds some needed heft, vigor, and yield to the normally stingy Pre-'98 Bubba Kush mom.  The different phenotypes are almost like different strains, with the Bubba-dominant phenos taking on the rounded shape and large calyxes of the mother, and the Tang Tang growing pointed colas with leaves coated from stem to tip with trichomes.  A skilled selection process will yield incredible results with this one.  Pre-'98 Bubba Kush x Tang Tang malesThis strain was released in 2010 by Grindhouse Medical Seeds.  The particular phenotypes shown above were isolated by breeder ""Tierra Rojo"" during that same year, in an effort to find the two ends of the parental spectrum.The Bubba-dominant plants definitely recall the mother, but have a less foreboding and musky aroma, seemingly being freshened up by the herbal and zesty Tang Tang.  Both phenos have notes of incense, hash, citrus, and the backing  deep chocolate/coffee notes of the Bubba, but the Tang Tang just has less aroma overall, smelling mostly of the trichomes that coat every surface.With a background of the Bubba dankness, the flavor is lightened up by the Tang Tang, adding elements of citrus and herbs.  The flavor isn't overwhelmingly strong like a proper Bubba is, but it hands in the mouth in much the same way, reminding the user of the flavor seemingly at random for a while after smoking.The Tang Tang adds a potent package of head effects and seems to step up the overall potency of the Bubba.  The Tang Tang phenotypes have a very strong head presence, with a feeling of a boulder rolling around inside the back of the skull at times, as well as quite a bit of eye pressure fluctuation.  It has major mood elevating properties as well, finishing cleanly and without any sort of crash — it makes for a versatile medication suitable for day or night use.  The Bubba-dominant phenotypes are definitely heavier, and if let go long will pack quite the narcotic punch, aiding sleep and relaxing muscles.Grows well with heavy training such as ""super-cropping"", as the Tang Tang line adds more flexibility and strength to the often brittle Bubba branches.  Either phenotype produces much larger yields than the Bubba, with the Tang Tang phenos being especially prolific.  The nugs produced are extremely dense, so bud mold can be an issue in higher-humidity environments.  The Tang Tang plants will stretch at least twice their height when flowered, while the Bubba-dominant phenos stay slightly more compact.Northern CaliforniaGrindhouse Medical Seeds70 days, depends slightly upon phenotype (Tang Tang-dominant plants at times take longer to finish)"

The White,"Named ""The White"" for the color of the finished buds (which absolutely drip with resin glands), this strain seems to be somewhere in the Kush family but is thought to have come from Triangle, an elite Florida strain.  Though it's not considered a true OG among most collectors, it's reached the stratified air shared with those elite OG cuts in terms of rarity and overall value.  The potency tends to be the most noteworthy trait of the strain aside from its incredible appearance, with many growers complaining of an overall weak taste compared to other OG-derived lines.Unknown, thought to be a phenotype/S1 bagseed from TriangleStraight from Krome via Lucid on icmag.com forums:  ""My favorite plant in the garden.  It's got a few names around my way, but the most common is simple ""The White.""  For me, this is the one that I judge all others by.  This one has the high, flavor, potency, looks, everything.  The only thing is that it yields like crap.  I got it as a clone about 8 years ago from a friend and haven't stopped growing her since.  From what I've gathered it was from some seeds called ""The Triangle.""  Some friends grew it out and weren't too thrilled and gave a cut to a friend. When he grew it it was the bomb! It's been around in clone ever since.""Another tidbit from Krome: ""My strain 'The White' has no relation to White Widow to the best of my knowledge.  It's called The White for one reason only; the color of the buds when finished.  Looks like they were just rubbed in confectionery sugar or something.  The real name of the strain is ""Triangle.""  Got the name from being a 3 way cross.  Has nothing to do with location, as I'm far away from Cali and to the best of my knowledge, it was born and raised in my home town.  The Triangle Kush is another local strain that's been around for years.  I really don't want to get into its origins as it always seems to start a heated debate.""Very OG family line dominant in structure and yield, but the dried flower is just covered in large gland trichs - truly ""caked.""Lemon, pine, and hash, with some oddly sweet qualities creeping in at times — definitely ""kushy"" in nature, though not as sharp as some OGs, trending instead towards the musky side of things.Not necessarily known for its taste (many breeders cross it for its trichome coverage with another, tastier strain), The White gives off a pine-heavy taste with hints of Kush spice.  The smoke is thick and expansive, filling the chest and often causing coughing, especially on larger hits.Very strong starting from the relatively quick onset, The White smacks the user in the face with a variety of cycling facial and cranial pressure changes as well as a warming sensation that creeps up behind the eyes.  The body buzzes, and the entirety of the patient generally feels heavily medicated by 30 minutes in — though The White tends to keep the user sedentary, the mind remains fairly active and acute.  A good strain for relaxing, it calms the body and mind without being overtly heavy or indica in nature until later in the duration, when the eye effects tend to lull the user to an early slumber.  With strong mental and physical effects, The White has solid muscle-relaxing, pain relief, and anti-anxiety properties as well as stimulating appetite.  The effect tends to get heavier as it goes along, so some patients will find sleep aid properties to be present as well.The White is a pretty big feeder, though not a great yielder… it normally stretches 100-125% during flowering and responds well to early topping.  Fairly aggressive pruning of lower branches is recommended to maximize production of top and ""neckbone"" bud sites, which will produce the best, most dense final product.  It yields a little bit better than some finicky OG varietals, but is still definitely a connoisseur ""headstash"" type of plant as opposed to a production plant.  Copious early resin production makes some people cut her early, but the last few weeks is when she really piles on the trichomes, so patience is a virtue.Likely of Pakistan-Afghanistan origin originally, The White was popularized by Krome, who is out of the Southeast USAElite clone-only variety, though The White has been used in several crosses by breeders such as Dutchgrown Seeds, OGRaskal/Elite Genetics, and Reservoir SeedsSome growers take it as early as 50 days, but it's most ready at around day 57-59, when the resin production is at its maximum."
The Wiz,"Without knowing much about what goes into this cross, it's hard to say which elements of the breeding were picked up in the experience. It was definitely Sativa-dominant during the initial effects part, but shifted gears heavily around the mid-way point, making this feel more like a 60/40% Sativa type of hybrid experience. The structure and texture were superb, while the rest of the ""bag appeal"" areas were only average. This one started off rather potent but seemed to tail off majorly, with the 2nd half feeling more like residual effects than anything. Overall though, we recommend this to mid-level patients who desire a smooth-smoking Sativa hybrid that won't keep them at peak potency for too long while also providing some quality body/mental relaxation, possibly leading to sleep (we'd suggest it as a late afternoon/early PM strain).In-house cross bred by Karmaceuticals in Denver, COArrowhead shaped fern green calyxes, formed in loose open clusters, with burnt umber pistils, an average density of very long, thin-stalked trichomes with small heads, and a carpet of peltate trichomes and lithocysts.Though it wasn't pungent really, the smell was a pleasingly fresh-smelling blend of pine (at times with a chemical bent to it), vegetation, and a light sweetness.There just wasn't much to this sample taste-wise — it seemed to mostly taste like smoke. It was never unpleasant though, only taking a turn for the worse towards the very end of the session. The smoke itself was light and easy to inhale, making this a good choice for those who don't wish to cough.Coming on somewhat quickly but reaching its full potency around 20 minutes into the experience, this strain started us off with a Sativa-heavy package of effects combined with some body attention. A pulsing, energetic feeling throughout the body (and radiating up into the head) combined with some burning in the eyes and a spacey mental state, making this one feel rather potent to start. Despite the energetic body presence, we had the urge to stay seated, partly to process the experience. Once that passed, it took a hard left turn at Indica and left us even more pulled into the couch, with a heavy head/eyes, slouchy posture, and the urge to lay down.Clone"
Third Dimension,"The ""bag appeal"" for this one was very high, and it boasts a complex taste and smell package led into a supremely energetic but unfocused state that may be good for creativity but made it a little difficult to deal with daily tasks. This was a very strongly Sativa experience, complete with slight ""crash"" at the end — people who cannot handle the racy varieties should steer clear of this one, as that was its main property.Bred by TGA/Subcool to produce a fast-flowering tropical flavored SativaClaw shaped wasabi green calyxes, formed in loose open spiral clusters, with pale gold pistils, an average density of very short, average-stalked trichomes with average headsReminding us of expensive hand soaps, tropical fruit and dryer sheets, the aroma from the Third Dimension was a relatively sweet pine-citrus sharpness. with a little whiff of skunk The sweet elements came out more after a grind, but it was relatively pungent even in the jar.Much like the aroma but less pungent, the flavor was an odd, yet appealing mix of citrus chemical pine and an almost flowery/perfumed sweetness. We wish it was more pungent, but it was a bit of an ethereal taste. The primary mental effect was a sense of an almost frenzied focus that would jump between things but rarely stayed on the ""important"" ones… a scatter-brained focus if that makes sense. Due to that, the energy didn't feel particularly productive and left us unsure what to really do with ourselves at times. That eventually passed and left a much more focused and productive state, though without the buzzing energy… this med left us feeling a little drained by the end.CaliforniaSeed45-50 Days"

Trainwreck,"A legendary Northern California strain, Trainwreck is known for its potent and soaring Sativa effects package.  It's lemon-lime + menthol + acrid smell and taste is famous worldwide.  The plant itself often looks gray due to the heavy trichome coverage and has a vine-like heavily Sativa structure with minimal leaf count and large calyxes.Unknown, likely (Lowland Thai x Mexican Sativa) x AfghaniTrainwreck is thought to be a combination of a Lowland Thai variety that was brought back to the US in an attempt to mimic Thai Stick.  Crossing that with a Mexican Sativa (brick weed) and Afghani stock produced this plant that finishes fairly quickly once flowering is triggered.  The strain was perfected and popularized in Humboldt County, California, particularly Arcata, where the ""E-32? (meaning type E, 32nd rotation) Trainwreck became the eventual popular ""mother"".Citrus-menthol-pine is the dominant smell — it's sharp with an occasional fruitiness creeping through Citrus-dominant, sometimes carrying an acrid, fuely component and the same mentholated quality from the smell Sometimes racy, but always very potent, Trainwreck is in the ""crusher Sativa"" mold, delivering a nearly incapacitating package of mental effects that can be overwhelming to many patients.  It has shown benefits with nausea, migraines, and pain relief. Works great for SCROG — watch out at the end of flower, because true Trainwreck almost always gets hermaphrodite flowers appearing late in the cycle… often they're impotent, but it's wise to keep a close eye on them to avoid pollinating itself and other plants in your garden.Northern California, Arcata to be specificClone-only, though Green House Seed Company has released feminized seed stock that is supposedly made via ""reversed"" pollen from the original ""E-32? mother plantVery short once proper conditions are achieved and it begins flowering — it's known for being a ""time from germination"" type of strain that won't show sex for quite a while… it's around 42 days to finish once it starts flowering fully."

The #2 simply describes another phenotype, perhaps sprouted as a bagseed or modified backcross. Finished flowers still have a stickyness that OG heads appreciate. Thus the breakdown is less beady and sizable nugs must be grinded to unlock the magnificent flavor within the swollen calyxes. "
Triple Diesel,"This is one of the real ""crusher sativas"" that almost mimics an indica couch lock with its oppressive head high. We've found this in other diesels as well. The popularity of the standard Sour Diesel has pushed forward the palette for various Diesel varieties. Sour Diesel x Strawberry Diesel x NYC Diesel,Soily and slightly sweet in the jar, it breaks up to produce a fresh menthol-tinged soil scent when handled. It reminded one reviewer of freshly torn mint leaves… The pungency was pretty average, but it was enough to be noticed without being right near the bud.Not as tasty as we expected, it was a pretty standard Diesel type taste, with a soil tinge similar to what was presented in the smell. There were no traces of the NYCD or Strawberry Diesel influence with their brand of sweetness, it was mostly just a fuel and soil taste, but not a particularly pungent one. It burned down to a medium-light gray ash, showing that it had an above-average flush job.Major cerebral soaring rush, facial and occular pressure building for 30 minutes or more. The head high stays put but disconnects the legs, so while a crushing sativa experience is had there is no real movement unless it is necessary."

Warlock,"Crossed from ho-hum commercial strains (Afghani and Skunk #1), this plant was a bit of a surprise for Gerrit Slot, the owner/founder of Magus Genetics.  The plant shows some Sativa-dominant traits such as its high calyx-to-leaf ratio, its stretch after start of flowering, and its overall ""up"" effects. It's a branchy plant that is easy to manicure due to low amounts of leaves — the finished smell is generally a strong sweet/sour, slightly fruity combo.Skunk #1 x AfghaniAfter coming up with the cross out of necessity and discovering how potent the resulting plant was, Gerrit Slot hooked up with the Bluebird, a very popular coffeeshop in Amsterdam — this began to build the following for Warlock.  He essentially stopped breeding experiments with the Warlock at that point and simply kept it going by cloning the mother over and over again.  Eventually the Warlock would used in almost every cross that Magus Genetics offers. A strong, sweet, and sometimes sour aroma that is of the fruity variety.A sharp, somewhat hashy taste going in, with a sweet and soft fruitiness on the exhale.  The smoke can be a bit on the harsh and expansive side.A quality hybrid strain, the Warlock starts off with a mixed bag of Sativa effects such as a slightly pounding heart, a heady start, and a bit of anxiety/paranoia.  However, it calmed down rather quickly and provided a relaxing, even body-centric experience that lasted 2+ hours.  It showed benefits in general relaxation, pain relief, and sleep aid towards the end of the experience.Grows well in any medium — suggested grow style is to let the plants veg from seed for ~35 days and then kick them into flower.  There is an outdoor Warlock from Magus called ""Biddy Early"" (Warlock x Early Skunk F2) that took 2nd Prize at the 2003 High times Cannabis Cup for the Sativa category, beating out indoor-grown competition.Afghanistan, Colombia, Mexico — bred by Magus Genetics in The NetherlandsAvailable in seed from Magus Genetics55-60 days, with some requiring slightly longer"
